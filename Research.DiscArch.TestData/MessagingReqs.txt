R1. The system must support sub-second message delivery under normal operating conditions.
R2. In the event of infrastructure failure, the system must automatically utilize neighboring devices to ensure message delivery.
R3. The system should prioritize message delivery based on urgency during an emergency, as determined by embedded NLP algorithms. 
R4. The system should offer both biometrics and social authentication. 
R5. System updates should be deployable remotely without interrupting ongoing messaging services.  
R6. During a disaster, the system guarantees eventual message delivery without a specific time constraint. 
R7. In normal conditions, the system must encrypt messages end-to-end to ensure privacy and security. 
R8. The messaging system should integrate with existing social media platforms for wider accessibility. 
R9. In case of a detected disaster, the system should automatically send alerts to all users. 
R10. The system must allow the textual messages to be up to 10K words during normal conditions and up to 100 words during an emergency.
