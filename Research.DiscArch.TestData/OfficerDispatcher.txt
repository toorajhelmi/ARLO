R1. The system shall allow officers to report their status (e.g., available, busy, on break).
R2. The dispatch system must deliver sub-second response times to ensure officers receive updates and dispatch orders promptly.
R3. The system must function without interruption, providing continuous service even in adverse network conditions.
R4. Officers shall be able to receive and acknowledge dispatch orders through the system.
R5. The user interface should be intuitive and straightforward, allowing officers to log incidents and request support quickly without extensive training.
R6. The system should optimize resource allocation to reduce operational costs without compromising service quality.
R7. The system shall enable officers to record audio statements and take notes within the incident report feature.
R8. The system shall provide a map interface displaying the locations of incidents and dispatched officers.
R9. The system must implement end-to-end encryption to protect sensitive dispatch information in transit and at rest.
R10. It should dynamically scale resources to accommodate the fluctuating number of active officers and incidents, ensuring consistent R1. performance without overuse of resources.
R11. Backup and recovery procedures must be robust to prevent data loss and ensure system reliability in case of failures.
R12. Officers can directly attach photos and videos to their incident reports through the system interface.
R13. The system should offer streamlined workflows for common tasks such as reporting incidents, requesting backup, and accessing case R1. information.
R14. It must utilize cloud services and scalable infrastructure to adjust to budget constraints while maintaining high service levels.
R15. The system shall maintain a log of all dispatch communications and actions taken by officers for accountability and review.
R16. Officers shall be able to access a database of local laws and regulations through the system for reference during patrols.
R17. Regular security audits and updates are required to address new vulnerabilities and ensure the system's integrity.
R18. The system must process and analyze incident data efficiently to provide timely and relevant information to officers in the field.
R19. It should ensure data integrity and accurate incident reporting across all devices, even when switching between online and offline modes.
R20. Officers should be able to customize their dashboard to access the most relevant information quickly.
R21. The system shall offer a secure messaging feature for officers to communicate with the dispatch center and other officers.
R22. The data synchronization process should minimize network usage to reduce costs associated with data transmission, especially in areas with R1. higher charges.
R23. The system must operate securely even when officers use public or unsecured networks.
R24. During high-demand periods, such as public events or emergencies, the system's performance must remain stable to handle the increased load.
R25. The system must reliably synchronize data across multiple devices and platforms so officers can access the most current information.
R26. The system shall generate and send automated alerts to officers based on specific criteria such as incident proximity or expertise required.
R27. The system must provide officers with clear, actionable notifications and alerts during critical situations.
R28. The system shall provide officers access to historical data and analytics on past incidents and outcomes for informed decision-making.
R29. Efficient device battery life and data storage should be considered to minimize the cost of hardware replacements and upgrade costs.
R30. Data retention and deletion policies must comply with federal and state regulations to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of all information.
