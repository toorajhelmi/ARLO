R1. Base integration of core HDFS writer functionality with Spring Batch.
R2. Simple file writer that has existed in the spring hadoop samples.
R3. The tuple data structure should be backward compatible in functionality for use in spring batch.  Porting over FieldSet tests in spring batch to use the tuple data structure is one way help ensure that compatibility.
R4. Have a syslog.xml config file that can be added to a module and registered with a module registry.
R5. When there is support for boostrapping a http server in the reactor project, and inbound SI adapter and associated XD source module should be created.
R6. create enough of a design to develop additional stories.
R7. Initial simple handcoded implementation for straight through pipe and filter model, e.g. a | b | c
R8. A gauge just stores a number.  Implementations for in-memory and redis.
R9. A rich gauge stores a number and also rmd, min, max. Implementations for in-memory and redis.
R10. A simple counters can increment/decrement a number.  Implementations for in-memory and redis.
R11. A field-value counter is useful for bar chart graphs, Strings on x-axis and count on y-axis.  Maps well to zset in redis. Implementations for in-memory and redis.
R12. bamboo based
R13. multi project build. - look to Spring Framework for source of starting point.
R14. Gradle application plugin is a good starting point.  this should be the main server that would host SI based modules to do syslog->file ingestion (as an example)
R15. This provides common CRUD behavior and a shared interface that can be useful in testing scenarios.  
R16. RedisCounterRepository and RedisGaugeRepository have duplicated code that needs to be factored out into a one place.  One such duplication is the determination of the key name to use for persistence.  This should be abstracted out into a strategy helper class.
R17. There is duplicated code in Redis based repositories that related to expiry behavior, move into a common shared helper class and/or base class.
R18. Currently these implementations are in the spring-xd-dirt module, but they should be moved into spring-integration-redis. We are already depending upon Spring Integration 3.0 snapshots since the ChannelRegistry implementation is not yet at a milestone, so this should be okay for the Redis Channel Adapters also - until Spring Integration M2 is released.
R19. syntax:    {code}  tap @ somechannel --key=value | somecounter  {code}  
R20. Start to explore how the DSL can cover both advanced (non-linear) spring integration flows as well as spring batch jobs.
R21. A Spring Integration based @ServiceActivator that counts the number of messages using the Spring XD metrics support
R22. A Spring Integration based @ServiceActivator that counts the occurrence of field names, from either a tuple data structure or a POJO, using the Spring XD metrics support.
R23. Replace the use of Jedis with Lettuce as it has higher performance
R24. Trying to build spring-xd for the first resulted in lots of errors inside STS (I had an empty .m2 repo).
R25. Nested tuple structures shoudl be supported,  getTuple(int index), getTuple(String name)
R26. The difference between saving a new metric and updating an existing one needs to be defined.  Suggest that if we try to save when an existing counter is already in the database to throw exception, such as DataIntegrityViolationException.
R27. The gradle application task should get us most of the way to create a distributable artifact akin to what you see when downloading tomcat/jetty etc.    Now there is a launch task    task(launch, dependsOn: 'classes', type: JavaExec) {  		main = 'org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.StreamServer'  		classpath = sourceSets.test.runtimeClasspath  	}      The same main should be referenced in the application plugin, a task to create a .zip distributable is needed.    Ideally would be nice to   1. download .zip  2. unzip  3. cd spring-xd/bin  4. xdserver start      and gracefully shutdown later with     5. xdserver stop    I don't know if we can/should bundle redis, I think we should bundle it.    The scripts can be for unix/linux and for windows.      Discuss a brew based install as well.  
R28. Do not require a POJO in order to do end-to-end processing in a batch step.
R29. Update a gemfire region.
R30. The value is mutable so this causes problems if storing metrics in a HashSet, for example.
R31. - Host the Spring XD distributable zip somewhere that is accessible by external http request.  - Create brew formula for Spring XD install while specifying redis as dependency.   - starting up stream server upon successful brew install    couple of questions:  - should we name the brew task springxd? (name not taken yet)  - should we start the stream server as part of the brew install process?  - should we specify redis as a recommended dependency? user can pass in 'brew install springxd --without-redis' to skip redis installation. by default, 'brew install springxd' will install redis as well.
R32. Based on a single process running a Spring Batch job, support the ETL of data from HDFS to a RDBMS
R33. Based on a single process Spring Batch job, ETL of data from HDFS to MongoDB.
R34. Adopt Asciidoc as the markdown syntax, useful for generating pdf and more feature rich than standard github flavored markdown.  Loosely following the conventions of https://community.jboss.org/wiki/TheHolyGrailAsciiDocOnGitHubToDocBookTrain that have generate docbook/pdf docs from the Asciidoc wiki.    The asciidoctor project is a key element in the adoption of AsciiDoc for use as the format in github, it is the rendering engine used by github for AsciiDoc.  See http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/ for guidance.    
R35. The Java UUID class is known not to be the fasted implementation available.     See https://github.com/stephenc/eaio-uuid and http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.eaio.uuid/uuid for high perf impls.  
R36. stream should be able to ingest data from http 
R37. in additional to existing tests that check for redis connection, we need to add tests that start/stop stream server. 
R38. for linux and mac
R39. Put on the guide as a section in an 'input sources' wiki page.    https://github.com/springsource/spring-xd/wiki/GuideGettingStarted    
R40. Put on the guide as a section in an 'streams' wiki page.    End user focused, no need to mention spring underpinning, impl details.    
R41. Put on the guide as a section in an 'input-stream' wiki page.

R52. Put on the guide as a section in an 'input-stream' wiki page.      
R53. Normalize and refactor as needed functionality currently included in   - spring-integration-core (LocalChannelRegistry)  - spring-integration-module (Module types upon which Flow are built)  - xd-module (Depend Module types common to DIRT and Spring Integration)  - spring-integration-flow (Flow specific types, namespace support, etc)
R54. Test and document e.g. "http | flow1 | flow2 | file"
R55. Currently modules are assumed to be in classpath:/META-INF/spring/integration/module/${flow}.xml. To reuse modules defined with DIRT  may require more flexibility.  e.g.,   <int-flow:flow root-path="file:///dirt/module"/>
R56. This should be a core feature of any Spring based module. The plugin should be able to import explicitly referenced beans. This minimizes potential side effects of making the module a child context and is simpler than declaring a shared context (parent) of the application and the module. Provide namespace support for flow:
R57. A Flow or a processor component may require routing semantics. Currently the stream assumes a single input and output for each module. A Flow may support multiple outputs - Switch routing that is - Recipient list is not currently supported (another subtask?). We need to support semantics like:  a |[output.foo:c,output.bar:d,default:e]
R58. For people who are familiar with Spring/Spring Integration provide documents that show how to add additional input sources/sinks.
R59. https://build.springsource.org/browse/XD-SONAR-34    Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.sonar.api.Plugin          at org.codehaus.plexus.classworlds.strategy.SelfFirstStrategy.loadClass(SelfFirstStrategy.java:50)          at org.codehaus.plexus.classworlds.realm.ClassRealm.loadClass(ClassRealm.java:244)          at org.codehaus.plexus.classworlds.realm.ClassRealm.loadClass(ClassRealm.java:230)          ... 94 more
R60. The Tuple classes in Reactor follow the more traditional data structure concept of Tuples, an immutable fixed length sequence of values where each value can have different types.  They are ordered and can often be access by index.    An example in a static language is the Tuple class found in .NET http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.tuple.aspx or in Scala http://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/scala_tuples.htm    Using this standard definition of a Tuple, they do not support named values.  There is also a different tuple class instance for each length, e.g. Tuple<T1,T2>, Tuple<T1,T2,T3>.    The Tuple class in XD is more like a record or named tuple.     Python has a named tuple concept - http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple    and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1490413/languages-that-allow-named-tuples shows that other languages use the term 'Record' for a 'named tuple' - Haskell, Standard ML, OCaml, and F#.    http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/Tuples_and_Records#Defining_Records    So boiling it all down, to avoid conflicts of names, and also to open up the possibility of using Reactor tuples as keys (instead of strings for names), we should change the name to either NamedTuple or Record.  ATM, there is no direct relationship between Reactor's Tuple and NamedTuple (such as inheritance) and so probably Record is the way to go.      
R61. Provide optional command line arg to embed the container launcher, aka - xd-admin server.    XDContainer.sh --embeddAdmin
R62. This will launch the RedisContainerLauncher, in future will be able to select from a variety of middleware options.
R63. should explain basic layout of the distribution
R64. should contain apache licence
R65. $ ./xd-container  processing module 'Module [name=file, type=sink]' from group 'tailtest' with index: 1 processing module 'Module [name=tail, type=source]' from group 'tailtest' with index: 0   Logging of 'processing module' should have log level, time..
R66. A ctrl-c of xd-admin results in exception messages about disconnecting from redis.  14:16:07,327 ERROR task-scheduler-1 handler.LoggingHandler:136 - org.springframework.data.redis.RedisSystemException: Redis command interrupted; nested exception is com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisCommandInterruptedException: Command interrupted 
R67. We are packaging separate scripts to start XDAdmin and XDContainer.  The Gradle application plugin will generate an unwanted 'spring-xd-dirt' scripts, this should be removed from the bin directory when creating a distribution zip.
R68. This is in the AdminMain and ContainerMain.      Can get the environment property directly in java code unless provided explicitly on the command line using --xdHomeDir.
R69. The final directory structure should look like    <install-dir>/xd  <install-dir>/redis  <install-dir>/gemfire    inside the XD directory     /xd/bin - which has xd-container and xd-admin scripts  /xd/lib    inside the gemfire directory  /gemfire/bin - has the gemfire-server script  /gemfire/lib     inside the redis directory is     /redis/redis-latest-v.x.y.z.tar  /redis/README  /readis/install-redis  - script that does the basic 4 commands to install redis.      There should be a gradle task that runs after the distZip task, that will take the contents of different project directories, script diretories and 'redis-binary' directories and creates the final layout for the distribution.
R70. This assumes the redis source tar is available under $rootDir/redis/redis-2.6.13.tar.gz    The install script does the following:    - Check the platform OS & arch  - unzip the tar, compile the sources
R71. It should provide an 'expression' param for SpEL and have a default pass-thru of the payload.
R72. It should provide an 'expression' param for SpEL and have a default value of true (accept everything).
R73. This will enable the use of groovy scripts within modules.
R74. This should facilitate testing while avoiding any class dependencies. Also, log is a generally useful sink by itself and time is a more interesting source for testing (should accept --interval for the seconds between time messages).
R75. The current default is hdfs://localhost:9000 but most new distributions/installs use 8020
R76. Spring-integration version is changed to 3.0.0.M2 and since we manually create the XD scripts, they still point to the 3.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT version.  As discussed, we also need to have a better strategy on updating the lib directory inside the XD scripts.
R77. We currently have the manually created XD scripts. This makes it difficult to maintain as the lib path is error prone with the changes. We need to make sure that the properties such as lib path etc., are dynamically updated.
R78. Need to shutdown cleanly, no exception messages are shown.  Order of components in the stream should be shut down from 'first to last'  (opposite of creation)
R79. This will eventually be supplied by the admin server, but for now write it up by hand in the documentation
R80. Based off SI tcp inbound adapter.  This will allow for event forwarding that can select among the existing SI serialized/deserializer options. 
R81. Based off SI tcp inbound adapter.  This will allow for event fowarding.
R82. To allow for groups of beans to be defined or not in the container that runs a module.    When deploying a stream (e.g. via the REST API), it should be possible to also provide profile names. Then those would apply to any modules within that particular stream deployment.
R83. Similar to what would show up on structure101 reports.
R84. Asciidoc/doctor might have one as part of it toolchain
R85. Show overall flow of data in a stream, the server components 'admin' and 'container'.  How modules are deployed.
R86. Pointers to other documentation on how to install hadoop. 
R87. Building XD should not be part of the out first out of the box experience, but we should include some instructions on what targets are available, such as distXD.
R88. The syslog source currently is hard-coded to use udp on port 11111.    Need to parameterize the port and provide an option to use TCP.
R89. Currently, the install-redis script uses relative path to determine redis source  dist file. Since this is error prone, we need to fix it.
R90. The {{ModuleDeployer}} calls {{getBeansOfType}} before the context has had its {{PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer}} attached. This can cause issues with {{FactoryBean}} s with placeholders in constructor args because the unresolved placeholder is used when the {{FactoryBean}} is pre-instantiated to determine the type of object it will serve up.
R91. We need to have an externalized property file(under xd/conf/) for the xd-container & admin scripts to use as options. 
R92. Currently redis project uses application plugin to bundle distribution. This also includes 'java plugin' which causes java specific build behavior on this project. We should try removing the use of application plugin and use something similar or custom tasks that does the bundling. 
R93. Redis is not running we get a nasty stacktrace:    {code}  ~/dev/git/spring-xd/dist/spring-xd/xd/bin (master)] ➔ ./xd-container   13/05/29 16:17:15 INFO support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext: Refreshing org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext@851052d: startup date [Wed May 29 16:17:15 EDT 2013];

Did you start or install Redis? Please see for further help http://foo/bar      
R94. Publishing an html version of the guide that uses the 'toc2' style format, table of contents on the left.    Looks like a 'stylesheet factory' http://asciidoctor.org/docs/produce-custom-themes-using-asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory/  needs to be installed.    From the theme showcase, http://themes.asciidoctor.org/preview/, the 'golo' theme has a toc2 style.    In the root of the git repo for the wiki is a build.gradle file that uses the asciidoctor gradle plugin, but it doesn't support using a single file with import as input. (See See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/issues/15 )    The mvn plugin does support this, so maybe using mvn is an option or just a bash script.
R95. Currently, Bamboo's gradle artifactory plugin has the artifacts configured to projects target(build) directory 'archives'. We need to have a way to set the final distribution archive as one of the gradle 'configurations' in our build.gradle and refer it inside bamboo artifacts.
R96. Presently, Spring XD does not ship Windows binaries for Redis. However, Microsoft is actively working [1] on supporting Redis on Windows. You can download Windows Redis binaries from:    https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/tree/2.6/bin/release     [1] http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2013/04/22/redis-on-windows-stable-and-reliable.aspx
R97. Spring config for rich gauge plus message handler to coerce a numeric or string payload to a double.
R98. Spring config for simple gauge plus message handler to process message. There is some code common to RichGaugeHandler to coerce the payload to a double that should be refactored for reuse.
R99. Shouldn't we have something like a ContextRefreshedEvent Listener and output some informational messages to the console, so the user knows the Container is up (Which contexts. Maybe even print a link to the docs))? Maybe even some simple ascii art (for demos)? Right now it looks somewhat barren.    Redis provides something similar.    This may even go hand in hand to provided a better configuration model (storing common config parameters centrally)      {code}     _____            _              __   _______      / ____|          (_)             \ \ / /  __ \    | (___  _ __  _ __ _ _ __   __ _   \ V /| |  | |    \___ \| '_ \| '__| | '_ \ / _` |   > < | |  | |    ____) | |_) | |  | | | | | (_| |  / . \| |__| |   |_____/| .__/|_|  |_|_| |_|\__, | /_/ \_\_____/           | |                  __/ |                         |_|  v1.0.0.M1      |___/   eXtreme Data    Using Redis at localhost:6379      The Server (PID: 12345) is now ready on http://myserver:123/streams    Documentation: https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/wiki           {code}
R100. A processor module that accepts either the location of a groovy script resource or an inline script (string). Also some discussion about a default classpath location for scripts. 
R101. We would like to have Redis driven from a config property file under XD_HOME.
R102. In both cases there are multiple application contexts that can be running in the process.  The JMX Managed bean should call 'close' on those application contexts.  The more detailed lifecycle of cleanly shutting down components within those application contexts is another story.
R103. This will allow for a simple way to shutdown the server via an HTTP call.  Support for security is a separate story. The end goal is to have some shell scripts distributed that can issue HTTP requests to shutdown the xd-admin and xd-container servers.    The newest version of Jolokia has the ability to boostrap itself inside an application context vs. requiring a java agent.  I suspect using the application context approach will provide us with more flexibility (e.g. property replacement etc) but not sure.
R104. Parameter parsing does not work if an argument contains '--'.    For example:    {code}  ... | transform --expression=42 | transform --expression=--payload |...  {code}    Also, I was surprised that this worked..    {code}  | transform --expression=new StringBuilder(payload).reverse() |  {code}    ... but this didn't...    {code}  | transform --expression='new StringBuilder(payload).reverse()' |  {code}    I think we need to tokenize the argument (with ' if contains spaces) and remove any surrounding '...' from the result. This means if someone wants a SpEL literal they would have to use something like     {code}--expression=''Hello, world!''{code}    resulting in a SpEL literal 'Hello, world!'
R105. The wiki repo contains a script, gen-docs.sh, that we are planning to use to generate a pretty HTML version of the Getting Started guide.     We should consider using maven (or gradle, but there is currently an issue documented in build.gradle) to generate this and other reference docs and publish them automatically as part of a nightly build.
R106. The conversion should be based on content-type headers, similar to the way Spring's HttpMessageConverters work (with mime types).    Also, the map of available converters should be extensible while including the most common defaults (for JSON, XML, etc). We most likely want to add a few of our own content types also (e.g. for Tuples).    Most likely, this logic and the configuration methods for extending the converter map, belong in AbstractChannelRegistry since it should be common across all implementations (i.e. the logic should be the same regardless of the transport used after-serialization/before-deserialization).
R107. example:    {code}  a | (b | c) | d  {code}    ...where b and c modules are deployed together as a composite module.    There are 2 options (maybe more) for how we could handle that. One would be defining a CompositeModule type that simply bridges the channels (b's output to c's input in this example). The second option would be to deploy those together on the same node as modules but using the LocalChannelRegistry between them.  
R108. Validate that modules have required channels declared according to their type.  Currently the stream deployer accepts processors with no input, but the stream doesn't complete. We should fail earlier and more loudly.
R109. We should have an externally editable log4j config file in a conf dir and the default should log to a file (presumably in a logs dir)
R110. We need to have the XD container & admin reading the registry specific property based on the registry type selected.   From Mark F, on one of the code review comments:  Maybe rather than having redis, rabbit, etc. properties all within a container.properties we should rely upon naming conventions instead. Specifically, we could have a single configurable property for the type of channel registry ("redis", "rabbit", or "local" being possible values), and then we could use something like:  <import resource="config/${registry.type}.xml"/>  <context:property-placeholder location="config/${registry.type}.properties"/>
R111. Trying to run XD offline results in an error in redis.xml because the cloudfoundry schema file is missing.  We need to add the cf-runtime jar to the classpath to resolve this.
R112. Add more structure, more easily find the reference guide.  The style that is here  https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki is nice. 
R113. A minimal project page of a 'top level project' page that has basic information of docs and links to the github wiki page.   No need to list maven coordinates.
R114. bottom home page - list of projects  data/integration category landing pages - related projects.  
R115. Document how to take an existing input/output channel adapters in spring integration and add them as a XD source/sink module.    Should be as end-user focused, step by step guide as possible.    Consider including a getting started gradle/pom.xml 
R116. The use case is to write custom code that does processing on a specific domain class (perhaps from twitter adapter) or a tuple.  Need to package up this code so that it can be used inside XD.  
R117. 2-3 containers (separate processes) that the stream: syslog | tcp   1 container (separate process) that aggregates the data sent from those conainers, tcp | severityFilter | hdfs              
R118. This could easily be supported in the existing gauge by adding a setAlpha method to RichGaugeService and adding the extra parameter "alpha" to the gauge data (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_moving_average). If not set it would default to the current behaviour (simple mean), otherwise it would calculate the exponential moving average in place of the mean.
R119. The current incrementAndGet approach based off redis will not easily be applicable in local model deployment
R120. The xd-singlenode script will launch a main application that creates both the admin node (to process http admin requests) and the container node (to execute modules for data processing) within in the same process     the xd-admin script will launch a main application that creates only the admin node (remove current embeddedContainer options)    the xd-container script will launch a main application that creates only the container node (as it is now)
R121. The name 'pipeProtocol' is tentative.      1. The command line scripts for xd-admin and xd-container would support a --pipeProtocol option, with the default being to use Redis.  (Otherwise use xd-singlenode).  2. The xd-admin and xd-container scripts will use the value of pipeProtocol to set the java system property xd.pipeProtocol when launching the app.  
R122. launcher.xml can make use of the system property xd.pipeProtocol inside an import statement.  This determines which version of the XD infrastructure to load, for example what ChannelRegistry implementation, Local or Redis based, or specific message listener containers.   File name conventions should be used, so if the option passed in from the command line is --pipeProtocol localChannel  then the XML filename looked for has the 'Protocol' suffix applied, e.g. localChannelProtocol, and is loaded via the classpath.  Redis and Local will not be the only options, other implementations will be provided in the future, e.g. Rabbit, and the user may be able to provide their own implementations of these infrastructure classes (an advanced task).  
R123. The redis specific beans that are defined in the current launcher.xml should move into this configuration file.   
R124. The current StreamServer depends on RedisStreamDeployer. Call this RedisStreamServer and extract interface to allow alternate implementations
R125. Create StreamDeployer that does not depend on an adapter implementation
R126. This script will launch XD admin along with the module container.    As part of this implementation, we will also remove the embedded options for XD admin & container scripts.
R127. a stream such as time | filter --script=oddMinuteFilter.groovy | file     would load the groovy script 'oddMinuteFilter.groovy' that is located in the directory modules/processor or perhaps in modules/processor/scripts.    Not sure the benefit of having a subdirectory below processor just for scripts.
R128. The --embeddedX options are a bit confusing in code right now, as the Admin can embed the Container and vice-versa. I guess we should only keep the Admin>Container side of things.
R129. XD-106 included detailed logging about the Redis metadata within the RedisContainerListener, but it seems as though that info could be logged somewhere closer to the establishment of a Redis connection for the XD runtime (and could be logged even if this listener, whose main role is to capture Container-related events, is not enabled).
R130. With the new option of starting without requiring redis, the getting started documentation should reflect this easier way to start processing data.
R131. Currently internal config files are in META-INF/spring with fairly generic names. To avoid potential collisions if users add their own configuration in the classpath, we should have a more unique location, e.g. META-INF/spring/xd
R132. If a user needs to deploy a module containing custom code, they have to build a jar for the lib dir and somehow deploy the app context file separately to a modules dir.  This is a bit inconvenient to build from a project, since context files in src/main/resources typically get built into a jar.    Might be better to accept both jar and xml files in the modules dir, though that brings up the issue of classpath isolation.
R133. When running in local mode (no Redis) {{time | tcp}} no longer works.    Change the {{time}} source to emit the date as a String, while allowing an option to emit a {{Date}} object.
R134. Replace the existing DSL parser that uses string indexing with a more robust one based on a derivative of SpEL.  This will provide a stable base on which to quickly iterate on syntax.  
R135. This will enable arbitrary processing logic to be used in a processing step.    See http://blog.springsource.org/2011/12/08/spring-integration-scripting-support-part-1/    <int:service-activator ...>    <script:script lang="groovy" location="file:scripts/groovy/myscript.groovy">  </int:service-activator>    would be the essence of the module.  Probably 'lang' gets detected from the file extension.
R136. {{curl -X POST -d "time --interval=3 | transform | log" http://localhost:8080/streams/test}}  results in the following stack trace in the DEBUG log.

R137. While deleting a stream doesn't remove any taps right now, we should be able to explicitly delete a tap.    Determine whether the current DELETE works and, if not, make it so.
R138. Creating a tap throws an exception. In local mode: Cannot resolve reference to bean 'redisConnectionFactory' while setting constructor argument; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No bean named 'redisConnectionFactory' is defined  But also fails when using redis.  
R139. Currently the XD scripts are broken in windows. 
R140. I don't see that we have automated tests for the modules we provide out-of-the-box.  We could make the modules folder an Eclipse project (which would also help solve XD-198) and add some integration tests similar to those documented here:    https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/wiki/Creating-Custom-Modules
R141. Fill in https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/wiki/Processors
R142. Filter, Transform, and Script modules all assume the provided script is written in Groovy.     This is partly due to the fact that the "lang" attribute of <int-script:script> can't be set to a property value (i.e. lang="${lang:groovy}"), which would allow users to pass in the expected language. Or perhaps we could use a SPEL expression or script to pick the language based on the file extension?
R143. Currently, the system property xd.home is set as JVM_OPTS (via SPRING_XD_ADMIN_OPTS) into xd-admin & xd-container scripts.    Inside the ContainerMain & AdminMain, we need to check if this system property is set and use it. It seems like, this check is missing now.
R144. The config file modules/sink/hdfs.xml has a hardcoded value to locate the namenode.    	<hdp:configuration register-url-handler="false">  		fs.default.name=hdfs://localhost:9000  	</hdp:configuration>    the fs.default.name proprety should be configurable and we should also support loading an external configuration file using        <hdp:configuration properties-location="${xd.home}/config/hadoop.properties">       </hdp:configuration>    
R145. The wiki docs on creating custom modules have entire build.gradle files in them. Would be good to explore existing STS templates, maven archetypes, etc or create new ones for authoring custom modules.
R146. There shouldn't be a need to do a mkdir -p before sending data to a file sink.
R147. Currently StreamServer has setPort, but no way for end user to set it. 
R148. The asciidoc wiki should have a section (included in the _Sidebar.asciidoc as well) that describes the general usage of the DSL syntax.
R149. Since the changes for XD-202, twittersearch requires authentication. Need to update the docs to reflect this.
R150. The transform, filter, and script processor modules support passing in a properties-location for script variables. We need a default location on the classpath for users to provide custom properties files.
R151. Those property keys should then be provided as defaults for the placeholders in source/twittersearch.xml
R152. The issue arises because the link:document[Label] asciidoc macro is meant for "external documents" and creates {{<ulink>}} in docbook / {{<a href="document">}} in html, whereas we want {{<link linkend="anchor">}} / {{<a href="doc#anchor>}} resp. We also want it to continue working in github live view.    I guess what could work is to have the macro (either override the link macro or create our own if github supports that) that looks like :  {{link:document#anchor[Label]}}  (the #anchor works out of the box in asciidoc and should work in github) but override it for the html and docbook backends to render to the correct form.    The thing is, there are several ways to create/override macros (and templates they render to), some of which make sense to our setup:  - having asciidoc.conf in the directory of the processed document (http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#X27)  - having docbook.conf/html.conf in the directory of the processed document (http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#X27)  - defining macros using attributes (http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#_setting_configuration_entries)    I tried all of those, but to no avail. These DO WORK with plain asciidoc, but not with our toolchain. Don't know if the problem is with asciidocTOR or with the gradle wrapper though.        
R153. curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/streams/ticktock
R154. https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/wiki/Creating-a-Source-Module uses the SI twittersearch inbound channel adapter, which is no longer going to work once Twitter disallows anonymous searches.     Ideally we update the example to use a new version of SI-twitter that adds support for this (as opposed to the XD workaround.)
R155. parameter values that include spaces need to be quoted, but this becomes overly complex in this kind of case.  Here is what you want to say:    {code}  http --port=9995 | filter --expression=payload.matches('hello world')  {code}    With the rule 'parameter values that contain spaces must be quoted' it would be this:    {code}  http --port=9995 | filter --expression='payload.matches('hello world')'  {code}    But then to include single quotes within a single quoted string you need to use two of them: '' - so it becomes    {code}  http --port=9995 | filter --expression='payload.matches(''hello world'')'  {code}    Less than ideal.        
R156. for example, when using the 'twittersearch' source module, the "hashTags" are nested within "entities", and the value for hashTags is itself an object with a "text" field, so the following would be needed to count the actual value of interest:    {code}  tap @ tweets | field-value-counter --fieldName=entities.hashTags.text  {code}  
R157. We need to cleanup some of the duplicate gradle tasks that bundle spring-xd distributions.     Currently, distXD does the copy of distributions from "spring-xd-dirt", "redis" and "spring-xd-gemfire-server" projects into "$rootDir/dist/spring-xd".    And, the task "zipXD" makes the zip archive.    These tasks should be combined with the "distZip" & "docZip" tasks.    We also need to remove the duplicate artifacts configuration from these tasks.
R158. This is needed for the use of the webhdfs:// scheme to talk to HDFS over http.
R159. In documentation attached to M1, in Streams/Introduction section, there's {noformat} http --port 8091 | file --dir=/tmp/httpdata/ {noformat} while it should be: {noformat} http --port=8091 | file --dir=/tmp/httpdata/ {noformat} missing "{{=}}" in {{http}}
R160. configurable parameters should include the queue-name(s) and optional binding key pattern    connection info, such as host and port, should also be configurable but with defaults (localhost and default port), and that should likely fallback to a rabbit.properties file in the $XD_HOME/config directory
R161. we have a prototype gardenhose adapter that was built directly upon RestTemplate (streaming on a background thread), but Spring Social Twitter has an issue on its 1.1 roadmap that is relevant:  https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SOCIALTW-2  
R162. An aggregate counter rolls up counts into discrete time buckets.  There is an existing POC implementation in Java based off the library  https://github.com/thheller/timed-counter     The README there has a good description of the desired feature set.
R163. When a module is deployed, it should run in its own isolated classpath.  The current code has all dependencies in a single classpath, taken from the lib directory at startup.  This has a number of drawbacks, one of the most important is the batch jobs can not be contributed to the system at runtime.  The work for this epic is decoupled from any module deployment story.  The assumption is that there will be a directory layout as shown below.  Current layout  ./modules/. |-- common |-- job |-- processor |-- sink |-- source |-- trigger  And inside source |-- source |   |-- file.xml |   |-- gemfire-cq.xml |   |-- gemfire.xml |   |-- http.xml |   |-- jms.xml |   |-- mqtt.xml |   |-- rabbit.xml |   |-- syslog-tcp.xml |   |-- syslog-udp.xml |   |-- tail.xml |   |-- tap.xml |   |-- tcp.xml |   |-- time.xml |   |-- twittersearch.xml |   |-- twitterstream.xml   Using an example of the source directory from the current layout.e.g ./modules/source/file, the new layout would be  ./modules/source/file/lib/spring-integration-file.jar ./modules/source/file/config/file.xml   We should support both the new and old layout styles simultaneously.  There what is under 'file' directory is the 'package'  No .zip, war, is required.
R164. h2. Narrative  As the XD system, I need to be able to execute a job (or potentially a stream) based on a given condition (time, data existence, etc).  This story is intended is for a local trigger implementation but remote triggers will also need to exist.    h2.  Acceptance Criteria  # Implement the ability to register a time based trigger {{trigger <CRON_STRING>}} for example  # Implement the ability to register a file existence based trigger {{trigger <PATH>}} for example  # Implement the ability to execute a job via an anonymous trigger: {{job_name @ <CRON_STRING OR PATH>}}  # Implement the ability to execute a job via a job via the previously registered trigger: {{job_name @ trigger_name}}  
R165. h2. Narrative  As a developer, I need a way to deploy job configurations as well as the related custom code to XD.    h2.  Acceptance Criteria  # Provide the ability to register jobs that have been deployed as modules via something like {{curl -d "job" http://localhost:8080/streams/myJob}} where job is the name of the job definition located in /modules/job and myJob is the name of the resulting registered job  # Confirm that both "regular" jobs and Spring Hadoop based jobs can be packaged/run.
R166. h2. Narrative  As a user of XD, I want to be able to use a job as a source.  To do so, we need the output of a job to be written to a message channel    h2.  Acceptance Criteria  # Create a new ItemWriter in the Spring Batch project to write to a Spring Integration message channel.
R167. Running on Cloud Foundry (and other managed environments) we need to be able to specify a Redis password in addition to host and port.
R168. For stream creation we need to be able to specify:  source sink processor  - filter  - transformer  - script  etc. 
R169. Set up a basic Spring Shell project for XD Shell
R170. This is the basic setup of the commands file - no specific command implementations
R171. Pagination support, maybe querying by name as well
R172. GET /streams/{streamname}/modules     and  GET /streams/{streamname}/modules/{modulename}    The former returning links to the latter  
R173. So that clients (e.g. Shell or custom user program) are insulated from REST details (ala Cloud Foundry).  May go even further if we want a Java DSL for stream definitions (that may reuse Batch command POJOs btw): Difference between: xdClient.createStream("mystream", "http --port=9000 | file") and  import static stuff.*;  StreamDef stream = http().port(9000).pipe(file()); xdClient.createStream("mystream", stream);
R174. h2. Narrative  As an XD developer, I need to be able to use a batch job to stream data as a source.    h2.  Acceptance Criteria  # Implement the ability for a job to be defined as a source in the DSL  # Add the configurations for the batch infrastructure transparently to the user  # Add the ability to specify if the job is stateful (picks up where it left off if it stops or restarts at the beginning).
R175. Command line arguments (and especially their default values) are currently scattered around different places.    The aim is to regroup those in a common place (*Options classes make sense).    Also, not very happy with how System properties are used as a vehicle for options.transport / options.home
R176. h2. Narrative As XD, I need a persistent way to register job definitions (beyond the map registry implementation provided by Spring Batch).    h2.  Acceptance Criteria # XD should be able to register, unregister, and find job definitions via the registry. # The registry should be backed by Redis so that it is persistent.
R177. A file that is in the process of being written to should have a customized suffix added to the name, e.g. 'temp'.    Once the file is closed, the suffix is removed and replaced with another value - default value can be dependent on the serialization format used, but can be customized
R178. A strategy to roll over files that allows the user to choose between   1) the size of the file  2) the number of events/items in the file  3) an idle timeout value that if exceeded, will close the file
R179. Writing POJOs using CDK Data (Avro)  We should support both partitioned and un-partitioned.  This story addresses only un-partitioned.  Document limitations in terms of which Java types are supported and not supported by the Avro serialization 
R180. Currently, the RedisQueueInboundChannelAdapter has blocking operation when pulling the messages out of redis queue and this is not performant.     There are few ideas from the discussion to make it better:    1) Get more items from the redis queue per connection  2) We will also have compression of messages(at the channel registry) before being sent to the redis queue     We also need to investigate what redis connection strategy makes the RedisQueueInboundAdapter better. 
R181. Steps to reproduce:    1.  curl -d "http | log" http://localhost:8080/streams/testHttp    2.  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/streams/testHttp    3.  curl -d "http | log" http://localhost:8080/streams/testHttp    org.jboss.netty.channel.ChannelException: Failed to bind to: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:9000
R182. The installation script for redis fails on Ubuntu64 when trying to untar the redis distribution.  The script uses REDIS_ZIPNAME instead of REDIS_ZIP_PATH.      This bug will be seen on any Linux 64 bits platform and looking at the code, even Linux 32 bits platform.
R183. We should ensure that each Package of Spring XD is documented. Right now the created JavaDoc looks barren:    http://static.springsource.org/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M1/api/     
R184. The container application loads {{redis.properties}}, but for some reason the values are ignored, and defaults are used instead.  Repro steps: # Unpack Spring XD 1.0.0.M1 to a machine with no running Redis instance # Change /xd/config/redis.properties to specify a different hostname # Run /xd/bin/xd-container # Observe error about inability to connect to Redis on localhost  Workaround * Pass -Dredis.hostname={desired IP} as a JVM parameter
R185. The changes for XD-144 mean that log4j files are no longer in the library jars. The admin server already has a logging configuration which should be activated by the startup scripts, but the separate gemfire app doesn't.
R186. I wanted to have a rollover feature when I was streaming tweets to a file overnight, just to avoid dealing with a single enormous file (in case I collected more data than my demo could handle and needed to split it up).
R187. Twitter's streaming APIs have more capabilities than just the plain statuses/sample.json. In particular we should support the filter.json option and the use of "track" (https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/parameters#track) as well as other request parameters (delimited, language etc).
R188. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17157068/counter-analytics-in-springxd    The underlying issue is stream creation with a name already taken though
R189. It would be nice if we have a git repo for Spring XD performance testing.    This would enable us to have a common repository (rather than inside spring-xd as a subproject) for all performance related code specific to any module, message middleware etc.,   
R190. To send a pre-set message to process(es)
R191. So that we can validate the message content in the stream
R192. Be able to point to the processor xml file, e.g. modules/processors/transformer.xml, and have access to a source channel that drives messages into the processor and a output channel where output messages are send.  The outbound channel is queue backed.  Test sending JSON to a processor module that uses Tuples.

Be able to start the rabbitmq source just by pointing to modules/source/rabbit.xml, pass in some property file for parameters to be replaced, and outgoing message is placed in a in-memory queue backed channel for use with assertions to verify functionality.   2. Test for as many source types as is 'reasonable', e.g. MQTT/TCP testing might be harder than say rabbitmq. 3. Test that sending json, results in media-type header is set to json 4. Test that sending POJO,   "  POJO 5. Test that sending Tuple, "   Tuple 6. Test that sending raw bytes, " raw bytes 
R195. See XD-194 for additional considerations. Zip support should be similar to uber-jar, or possibly replace uber-jar support.
R196. WAR Vs. JVM Jolokia Agent    Jolokia Vs. JVM MBeanServer    Probably needs support for Spring Profiles.
R197. Global option?    Override for individual modules? module types?
R198. The shell should be an 'executable' delivered out of the box in much the same way that xd-container and xd-admin are right now. If we follow how redis/mongo distribut the shell, it sits side by side with the other binaries
R199. Need to capture exceptions from the various projects that make up XD and wrap them in XD Specific exceptions.  An example of this is when leaving out the channels in the module definitions, we see NoSuchBeanExceptions and IllegalArgumentExceptions thrown based on which module and what channel is missing. 
R200. This would be based off the spring-integration-extenstions splunk project.  The use of this adapter for storing tweet data is in  https://github.com/markpollack/springone    We should be able to reproduce the use case as done in that demo
R201. POST?
R202. TODO as part of this (see XD-537):   * Get rid of so-called Service layer in analytics project (doesn't do much right now, and logic would better live in the 'Handler' IMO) * Have REST controllers depend on XRepository in all cases
R203. TODO as part of this (see XD-537):   * Get rid of so-called Service layer in analytics project (doesn't do much right now, and logic would better live in the 'Handler' IMO) * Have REST controllers depend on XRepository in all cases
R204. TODO as part of this (see XD-537):   * Get rid of so-called Service layer in analytics project (doesn't do much right now, and logic would better live in the 'Handler' IMO) * Have REST controllers depend on XRepository in all cases
R205. TODO as part of this (see XD-537):   * Get rid of so-called Service layer in analytics project (doesn't do much right now, and logic would better live in the 'Handler' IMO) * Have REST controllers depend on XRepository in all cases
R206. updated story points to 14 since 5 of us just participated in a 2 hour call, and we still need to discuss "topology" support after some dev spikes later this week
R207. Create a load generator script which can generate messages at specific    1) Rate  2) Payload  3) Concurrency    to a specific tcp/udp port where a syslog adapter is listening.
R208. Investigate how efficiently we can integrate profiler into the performance test.
R209. We should be able to write a script that can examine the table structure for a given HAWQ table and then extract the data from JSON without the custom script we are using now.
R210. Document jmx command line options and refer to jolokia
R211. There is some conflicting Servlet API jars on the claspath that needs cleanup. Building and running with xd-singlenode script gave this error:    Jun 27, 2013 3:18:16 PM org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractHttp11Processor process  SEVERE: Error processing request  java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getEffectiveSessionTrackingModes()Ljava/util/Set;    org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.postParseRequest(CoyoteAdapter.java:674)    org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java:402)    org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractHttp11Processor.process(AbstractHttp11Processor.java:1004)    org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol$AbstractConnectionHandler.process(AbstractProtocol.java:589)    org.apache.tomcat.util.net.JIoEndpoint$SocketProcessor.run(JIoEndpoint.java:310)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.runTask(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:895)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:918)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:680)  
R212. The object naming is still not ideal for XD since SI conventions add some noise. Likely  need to design and implement a custom naming strategy
R213. I would like to see a module created that supports complex event processing.  I have reviewed GemFire Continuous Query but was not able to find a feature for time windows.    I have used Esper in the past for this type of processing.
R214. With the performance test run, the numbers (messages sent/received per second) keep varying as there are   "redis client connection timeout exceptions" (Caused by: org.jboss.netty.channel.ConnectTimeoutException: connection timed out) at both redis inbound/outbound channel adapters as I increase the total number of messages being processed (max. 10K/second).  Some of the exception messages for the review:  1) With connection pool (at Redis outbound):  Caused by: org.springframework.data.redis.connection.PoolException: Could not get a resource from the pool; nested exception is com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisException: Unable to connect  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.DefaultLettucePool.getResource(DefaultLettucePool.java:95)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.DefaultLettucePool.getResource(DefaultLettucePool.java:36)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceConnectionFactory.createLettuceConnector(LettuceConnectionFactory.java:318)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceConnectionFactory.getConnection(LettuceConnectionFactory.java:109)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisConnectionUtils.doGetConnection(RedisConnectionUtils.java:81)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisConnectionUtils.getConnection(RedisConnectionUtils.java:53)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisTemplate.execute(RedisTemplate.java:157)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisTemplate.execute(RedisTemplate.java:137)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.AbstractOperations.execute(AbstractOperations.java:84)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.DefaultListOperations.leftPush(DefaultListOperations.java:71)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.DefaultBoundListOperations.leftPush(DefaultBoundListOperations.java:67)  at org.springframework.xd.perftest.redis.outbound.RedisQOutboundChannelAdapter.handleMessageInternal(RedisQOutboundChannelAdapter.java:71)  at org.springframework.integration.handler.AbstractMessageHandler.handleMessage(AbstractMessageHandler.java:73)  ... 17 more  Caused by: com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisException: Unable to connect  at com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisClient.connect(RedisClient.java:176)  at com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisClient.connectAsync(RedisClient.java:139)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.DefaultLettucePool$LettuceFactory.makeObject(DefaultLettucePool.java:252)  at org.apache.commons.pool.impl.GenericObjectPool.borrowObject(GenericObjectPool.java:1181)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.DefaultLettucePool.getResource(DefaultLettucePool.java:93)  ... 29 more  Caused by: org.jboss.netty.channel.ConnectTimeoutException: connection timed out: localhost/127.0.0.1:6379  at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioClientBoss.processConnectTimeout(NioClientBoss.java:137)  at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioClientBoss.process(NioClientBoss.java:83)  at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.AbstractNioSelector.run(AbstractNioSelector.java:312)  at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioClientBoss.run(NioClientBoss.java:42)  2) Without connection pool (at Redis inbound):  Caused by: com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisException: Unable to connect  at com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisClient.connect(RedisClient.java:176)  at com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisClient.connectAsync(RedisClient.java:139)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceConnectionFactory.createLettuceConnector(LettuceConnectionFactory.java:321)  ... 12 more  Caused by: org.jboss.netty.channel.ConnectTimeoutException: connection timed out: localhost/127.0.0.1:6379  at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioClientBoss.processConnectTimeout(NioClientBoss.java:137)  at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioClientBoss.process(NioClientBoss.java:83)  at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.AbstractNioSelector.run(AbstractNioSelector.java:312)  at org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioClientBoss.run(NioClientBoss.java:42)  ... 3 more
R215. Trigger - Add support for fixed-delay interval
R216. Currently Jobs can be either executed using cron expression or immediately at once. We should also support the one-time scheduling of jobs in the future.    Would this possibly require us to implement schedule-persistence? That could severely impact story-points.
R217. - Container context should be separate from Admin Context in local mode (consistency across transports). Provide a LocalChannelRegistry to bridge deploy and undeploy channels to the ModuleDeployer    - Verify Plugins are not in common module context. They are only needed by the ModuleDeployer not the Modules.    - Add global-beans Config for beans to be shared among admin and container (and available to modules). This would be set as the parent context where needed. (Currently ‘analytics-context.xml’ and JobRepository shared by Admin and modules)    - Fix ModuleDeployer sets parentContext twice  - Rename common.xml to module-common.xml    NOTE: Analytics parent only required in local mode    - Write unit tests to verify configurations are as expected. Correct bean implementations and no stray beans or redundant instances where not needed    - Decouple Command options from System properties (in general XD property names), this gives us some flexibility in mapping to properties or profiles where appropriate  
R218. Need to understand how individual modules may or may not share Dispatchers that are part of the parent context.  If modules have their own dispatchers, those also need to be configurable.
R219. startup scripts on windows should be tested, xd-admin, xd-container, xd-shell.
R220. It might be worth creating a base class for Plugins that combines common concerns across plugins. E.g. That would allow us to hide the commonApplicationContext and BeanDefinitionAddingPostProcessor for common cases, instead exposing a simple addBeanDefinition method to sub-classes."
R221. Simple cron based triggers
R222. Redis based.
R223. Right now the PPC for jolokia mgmt is conflicting with the PPC used to resolve redis properties.  Need to determine a strategy such that multiple PPCs can be used.
R224. when posting the DSL to create a spring batch job  e.g. "trigger job.xml --option1=foo"    it should be stored (in redis) so that a listing of XD job definitions can be retrieved.
R225. Get closure on open discussion points for REST API wrt to streams, taps and jobs.  
R226. This is currently too chatty. It should be possible to use a single connection for each "increment" operation.
R227. Extend the DSL in the following ways:    - stream naming, use <name>'='  {code}  mystream = http | file  {code}    - module aliasing (for later referencing) use <label>':'  {code}  mystream = http | t1: transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | t2: transform --expression=payload.toLowerCase()  {code}    - sequence of job steps with '&'  {code}  mybigjobby = step1 --option=value & step2 --option=value  {code}    - Channels for sources and sinks, use '>', channels references prefixed ':'  {code}  // sink channel called foo  http | transform --expression=payload.toUppercase() > :foo  // source channel called foo  :foo > count | file  {code}    - Qualify channels with a stream ':'<stream>'.'<channel>  {code}  mystream = http | transform --expression=payload.toUppercase() > :foo  :mystream.foo > count | log  {code}      - Reusable substreams, define then reuse  {code}  myIntricateFlow = transform --expression=payload.toUppercase() | transform --expression=payload.toLowercase()    http | myIntricateFlow | file  {code}    - Parameterized substreams, use $XX or ${XX} to indicate parameters  {code}  obfuscateName = transform --expression=payload.replaceAll("${name}",XXX)    twitter --query=Bieber | obfuscateName --name=Justin | file  {code}    - Tapping (still not 100% happy about the format here)  {code}  mystream = http | filter | t1: transform XXX | t2: transform YYY | file    // These are then equivalent (tapping on a module is effectively tapping a channel, hence the '>')  tap filter > count | file  tap mystream.filter > count | file    mystream = http | filter > :foo    tap :foo > count | file  tap :mystream.foo > count | file  {code}  I'd still like to thing about removing 'tap' and using a symbol (perhaps '@', but @:mystream.foo is a little odd)    still not covered, topological constraints on the stream components.
R228. Deploy a named stream. The stream must exist in the StreamRepository
R229. optional --autostart switch to also deploy the job
R230. Deploy an existing job. Must exist in the JobsRepository
R231. To store it's definition and optionally deploy with --autostart flag
R232. see https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/drawings/d/1kCNbVspRBjGc10itF9cSkwST8WgCjgg3wGzFKqLCAzU/edit    Create the controller if it doesn't exist. Test with MvcTest
R233. see https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/drawings/d/1kCNbVspRBjGc10itF9cSkwST8WgCjgg3wGzFKqLCAzU/edit    Create the deployer if it doesn't exist.
R234. see https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/drawings/d/1kCNbVspRBjGc10itF9cSkwST8WgCjgg3wGzFKqLCAzU/edit    create optionally deploys
R235. see https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/drawings/d/1kCNbVspRBjGc10itF9cSkwST8WgCjgg3wGzFKqLCAzU/edit    Refactor current DefaultStreamDeployer
R236. see https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/drawings/d/1kCNbVspRBjGc10itF9cSkwST8WgCjgg3wGzFKqLCAzU/edit    create TapsController if necessary
R237. see https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/drawings/d/1kCNbVspRBjGc10itF9cSkwST8WgCjgg3wGzFKqLCAzU/edit
R238. see StreamsRepository as an example. This includes in memory and Redis implementations
R239. Have proper exceptions for common error cases on Stream creation/deployment and propagate those to clients correctly.
R240. Some (java) files are currently missing headers.    The plugin at https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin can help, but initial trial revealed that:    - skipExistingHeaders does not seem to be honored. We may then need to use a year construction like 2001-${current} or force all files to have ${current} year. Don't know the legal implications of this  - Default source sets encompass all files "in the classpath" basically, so that means .xml as well as .properties files for example. It would seem logical to add header to those as well, but I don't think this is what we do on other projetcs.
R241. As part of the Hadoop World demonstration work, the flow of data using XD from twitter to be analyzed by HAWQ as done.  Part of this work had the data going into HDFS that HAWQ was able to query using external tables.    The work for this story is to identify the concrete technical tasks/stories to be created do deliver and document this functionality in XD.    
R242. Currently you need to define a port which tomcat will use to bind to. If XD is embedded or run in a Hadoop it is not possible to know which port should be used. Current embedded tomcat version is able to use the 0-port trick for it to choose free port.  Real binded port can be asked from a connector using below example.  org/springframework/xd/dirt/stream/StreamServer.java: public int getLocalPort() {   return this.tomcat.getConnector().getLocalPort(); }   Also I believe Streamserver should provide a method to ask what is the real url to connect to or atleast what streamserver thinks what it is. This will make life much easier for components empedding spring-xd. 
R243. This should likely be in the "start the runtime" section of Getting Started section.
R244. This section should discuss what is exposed via JMX, how you can view it in JConsole, and how you can view it over http via Jolikia.    in particular showing how some existing metrics for inbound message channel adapters or the 'inbound' channel of the stream, that indicate the number of messages processed per section.      
R245. See http://static.springsource.org/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M1/reference/html/#getting-started    
R246. The chapter on how to start up the shell should ocme right after "start the runtime" and before "create the stream"
R247. the current streams chapter    http://static.springsource.org/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M1/reference/html/#streams    shows creation and deleting streams using CURL - switch to use shell.  Also add listing of a stream.    there is also an example of creating a stream, this should be replaced as well.  
R248. the current streams chapter    http://static.springsource.org/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M1/reference/html/#streams    shows using curl to post some data to a http source module,     curl -d "hello" http://localhost:9000    create a shell command so curl doesn't have to be used.    https://github.com/SpringSource/rest-shell    has a command already developed for this.
R249. There are existing commands that can be taken from     https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-hadoop-samples    or     https://github.com/SpringSource/impala    that can be used for this
R250. See http://static.springsource.org/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M1/reference/html/#http        
R251. The documentation in the Running in Distributed Mode chapter should discuss that the distributed runtime can use essentially any middleware to communicate between nodes.  This functionality is provided by the core ChannelRegistry abstraction.  A new intro paragraph shoul convey that it isn't a 'redis' only or 'rabbitmq' only system.  There should be "Installing RabbitMQ" and "Starting RabbitMQ" sections to match those for Redis.  "Starting Spring XD in Distributed Mode" should cover how to configure the system to select to use Redis or Rabbit.

R266. See   http://static.springsource.org/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M1/reference/html/#taps  The existing docs should be made to show a real stream being created with filter and/or transformer and then a tap that goes to logging.    The shell syntax to also stop/undeploy a tap should be shown here as well since the lifecycle is discussed.
R267. Add section to Analytics chapter on use of AggregateCounter.  The example should show the use of the shell to create the tap that uses the AggregateCounter.
R268. "test the deployed module" sub-section uses curl.

R271. time source is used in some examples, but it isn't documented explicitly, eg. --interval option in seconds.
R272. Avoid the need for {{--jmxPort=xxxx}} when running both a {{Container}} and {{Admin}} on the same server
R273. If Redis is not running, the container fails to initialize in {{ContainerMain.launch()}} because the connection factory attempts to eagerly connect.  If RabbitMQ is not running, the container fails to initialize in {{AbstractContainerLauncher.launch()}}.  Make the failure behavior consistent from a user perspective and add a spring-retry {{RetryTemplate}} to retry container startup.
R274. As a user, I'd like to have the option to delete the queues/topics so that we can include an _optional_ attribute as part of the stream destroy command to also clean-up the associated queues/topics.    *Notes:*  * Spring-AMQP {{RabbitAdmin}} now has a {{getQueueProperties()}} method which returns the number of consumers so it may be possible to use it for this purpose.  * Consider the possibility of _producers_ and/or _queues_ still containing data  * Consider the scenario even after the topics/queues are cleaned-up, what to do with fanout exchange?    *Some Further Thoughts*  * Consider using the upcoming Spring AMQP REST API {{RabbitManagementTemplate}} if the timing is not right, we could temporarily invoke the rabbit REST API directly.  * Should be optional; perhaps via {{stream destroy foo --clean}}  * Should this be done by the admin? Or, via a new plugin handling module undeployments - in the rabbit case, undeploying a consumer would check for us being the last consumer and remove the queue/binding/exchange, since we undeploy left->right, everything can be cleaned up on the consumer side.  * Third option would be new methods on the bus {{cleanConsumer}} etc invoked by the {{StreamPlugin}}  * Down side of doing it on the admin is that he wouldn't necessarily know which rabbit cluster a stream was deployed to - so it probably has to happen on the container - even so, we'd need the admin url(s) for the cluster.
R275. The basic launch configurations should be tested automatically to ensure that startup scripts and launch aren't broken by changes.
R276. Looking at the latest Sonar run we have 3 package tangles in Spring XD:  https://sonar.springsource.org/drilldown/measures/7717?metric=87
R277. The DSL changes under XD-369 now build stream Ast objects that can include a source and sink channel:    {code}  // Source Channel  :mystream.foo > count | log    // Sink Channel  http | count > :foo  {code}    These new fields in the Ast object need to be copied into the module deployment request objects and then used at the destination as the channels for wiring things together.  Currently the only channels used are the .NNN numeric channels where NNN is the index of the module in the stream definition. The source/sink channels are 'extra' channels that need creating - the source channel acting as a real source for the next module in the chain whilst the sink channel acts as a sink output for the last channel in the chain.      I can think of two ways to handle the implementation:  - In order to police the stream structure as "source | processor* | sink" maybe special SourceChannel and SinkChannel modules are created to represent these channels and when deployment happens the deployer understands that they don't represent a real request to deploy a module but simply the channels to wire up to the adjacent module.    - Carry source/sink channel info in the existing module definitions. But then the verification of source/processor*/sink structure will need modification to say a source isn't necessary if the first processor has a source channel attached and a sink isn't necessary if the last processor has a sink channel attached.  
R278. Following stream parsing there is now a stream resolution stage that chases down substream references and fills in parameterization. The 'lookup' of streams is done through implementors of the StreamLookupEnvironment interface. Currently the parser implements this itself but it is really a job for the stream directory.  The parser implementation doesn't know about stream deletions, for example, so may still resolve streams that no longer exist.
R279. The new parser supports | for connecting regular modules and & for connecting job steps. The modules in the ast that were connected with & are tagged but nothing is currently using that information (it doesnt get into the module deployment request). We need to think about using this data: policing the modules that are being deployed to ensure they are job steps, for example.
R280. With support for substreams/parameterized streams now in the parser it will be possible to create a stream that cannot be deployed: it may not fit the source/processor*/sink structure or it is a parameterized stream with no default values for parameters. Need to check how XD is going to handle these - after creating them, attempting to 'deploy' them should return appropriate errors. (They should exist in the stream directory).
R281. Once issues like XD-438 have been completed the wiki doc will need updates to reflect the current behaviour and syntax options.
R282. Dependent servers should be required on the CI server, but optional on developer systems.
R283. We need to have the ability to set read timeout for http request.  This is already implemented here: https://github.com/SpringSource/rest-shell/
R284. When running with "./gradlew launch" I get a 500 error when I try to re-deploy an undeployed stream. A subsequent create or destroy also fail  http://localhost:8080:>stream create --definition "time | log" --name ticktock Created new stream 'ticktock' http://localhost:8080:>stream undeploy --name ticktock Un-deployed stream 'ticktock' http://localhost:8080:>stream deploy --name ticktock 13:02:09,936  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:524 - PUT request for "http://localhost:8080/streams/ticktock" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler Command failed org.springframework.web.client.HttpServerErrorException: 500 Internal Server Error http://localhost:8080:>stream deploy --name ticktock 13:03:11,453  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:524 - PUT request for "http://localhost:8080/streams/ticktock" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler Command failed org.springframework.web.client.HttpServerErrorException: 500 Internal Server Error http://localhost:8080:>stream undeploy --name ticktock 13:03:54,576  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:524 - PUT request for "http://localhost:8080/streams/ticktock" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler Command failed org.springframework.web.client.HttpServerErrorException: 500 Internal Server Error http://localhost:8080:>stream undeploy --name ticktock 13:04:48,872  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:524 - PUT request for "http://localhost:8080/streams/ticktock" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler Command failed org.springframework.web.client.HttpServerErrorException: 500 Internal Server Error http://localhost:8080:>stream create --definition "time | log" --name ticktock 13:04:52,066  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:524 - POST request for "http://localhost:8080/streams" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler Command failed org.springframework.web.client.HttpServerErrorException: 500 Internal Server Error http://localhost:8080:>stream destroy --name ticktock 13:05:14,207  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:524 - DELETE request for "http://localhost:8080/streams/ticktock" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler Command failed org.springframework.web.client.HttpServerErrorException: 500 Internal Server Error  
R285. 2 options are: 1) Fire the trigger immediate - Launch the job when trigger can gather the resources necessary start the job 2) Do nothing - Ignore this job fire time and catch   this scenario can occur if XD is down or resources (threads) are not available at the time a job is to be launched. 
R286. The following will retrieve the names of all module types (eg- sources, sinks, jobs, processors, triggers).   {code} GET /module-types/ {code}  I'm expecting that the plural would be used, but singular would work as well.  The following gets modules of a given type: {code} GET /module-types/{type} {code}  This would be similar to the {{/modules/}} call in XD-265, but it would only return modules of the specified type.  
R287. If we want spring-xd to support interactions through a UI, then it would make sense that we should support the UI coming from a separate origin.  This way, the UI could remain a separate project and be served from wherever we want.  So, we would need to add the header to *all* outgoing REST responses. We may also need to add a {{Access-Control-Allow-Methods}} header as well.  In the short term, the {{Access-Control-Allow-Origin}} header could be hard coded to a specific url (I'm using http://localhost:9889 for now), but in the long term we would need this configurable.
R288.  In the case that there are not enough resources to fire a trigger, the highest priority will be fired first.
R289.   Commonly called Calendar support 
R290. A pause means that a trigger will wait to fire its job until after the pause is removed.  It does not apply the misfire behavior. 
R291. This is a master ticker tracking work enabling XD to run on Hadoop as Yarn application.
R292. For example, using tcpdump I can see both an exception and message information:  'HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8 Transfer-Encoding: chunked Date: Fri, 12 Jul 2013 13:38:26 GMT Connection: close  275 [{"links":[],"logref":"MessageHandlingException","message":"org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextException: Failed to start bean 'org.springframework.integration.monitor.IntegrationMBeanExporter#0#92e27d20-4c48-4131-866c-91b6cb642ca2'; nested exception is org.springframework.jmx.export.UnableToRegisterMBeanException: Unable to register MBean [MessageChannelMonitor: [name=nullChannel, sends=0, receives=0]] with key 'xd.tap1:type=MessageChannel,name=nullChannel,index=1,module=log'; nested exception is javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException: xd.tap1:type=MessageChannel,name=nullChannel,index=1,module=log"}]  However the client only shows:  http://localhost:8080:>tap create --name "tap1" --definition "tap@test1.file | log" --deploy true 14:38:26,113  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:524 - POST request for "http://localhost:8080/taps" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler Error creating tap 'tap1'  The error doesn't seem to be logged in the XD Admin server either, so the information is effectively lost.  
R293. Support toString() to emit JSON by default. Should be backed by a simple strategy to allow the possibility of other representations.  Also provide toTuple(String json). This supports seamless mapping JSON<->Tuple in XD
R294. There's a lifecycle problem when a tap creation fails (e.g. because the DSL syntax is wrong). Subsequent attempts to create the tap will fail with an error:   [{"links":[],"logref":"MessageHandlingException","message":"org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextException: Failed to start bean 'org.springframework.integration.monitor.IntegrationMBeanExporter#0#92e27d20-4c48-4131-866c-91b6cb642ca2'; nested exception is org.springframework.jmx.export.UnableToRegisterMBeanException: Unable to register MBean [MessageChannelMonitor: [name=nullChannel, sends=0, receives=0]] with key 'xd.tap1:type=MessageChannel,name=nullChannel,index=1,module=log'; nested exception is javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException: xd.tap1:type=MessageChannel,name=nullChannel,index=1,module=log"}]  Disabling JMX solves the issue.   reproduce Create a bad stream definition name 'bad' Try to recreate with the same name, but correct stream definitions.  The system will report that the stream already exists.
R295. spring-data-hadoop 1.0.1.RC1 provides flavors for commonly used Hadoop distros/versions and we should make use of that.
R296. we need a JDBC sink for writing to HAWQ (using int-jdbc:outbound-channel-adapter and postgresql JDBC driver)  
R297. we need a batching JDBC channel adapter (int-jdbc:outbound-channel-adapter is not batching statements AFAICT) 
R298. we need to modify build adding two sub-projects for spring-xd-hadoop: one for hadoop 1.1.2 and one for phd1 (Pivotal HD) to pull in transitive dependencies for correct Hadoop distro
R299. we need to modify startup script to use hadoop 1.1.2 as default or phd1 when specified with --hadoopDistro=phd1
R300. We need a generic script that can do JSON to tab-delimited text transformation for data written to HDFS/HAWQ external tables. Users should be able to specify columns/fields to be included.
R301. We need a sink that can write data in Avro serialized format. This story is for investigating what we would need to do to support that. The Spring Integration Kafka adapter provides Avro support for Kafka.
R302. This only happened with distributed mode that uses redis as store. The single mode which uses in memory store works fine.  Step to reproduce:  Create stream: curl -X POST -d "name=httptest" -d "definition=http|log" http://localhost:8080/streams  redis 127.0.0.1:6379> keys *httptest* 1) "modules:httptest" 2) "streams.httptest" 3) "stream.definitions.httptest"  Delete Stream: curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/streams/httptest  redis 127.0.0.1:6379> keys *httptest* 1) "streams.httptest" 2) "stream.definitions.httptest"  stream still there not deleted  Recreate the stream curl -X POST -d "name=httptest" -d "definition=http|log" http://localhost:8080/streams  Got: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?><errors xmlns:ns2="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"><error logref="StreamAlreadyExistsException"><message>There is already a stream with name 'httptest'</message></error>
R303. Spring HATEOAS is here to help. Nonetheless, there are currently a number of outstanding issues, namely:  https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-hateoas/pull/98 https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10262#comment-91685 https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-hateoas/pull/94  Creating a issue here for future reference
R304. A module can declare one ore more payload types it will accept. This will inform the runtime re. automatic payload conversion.  This can be done in the module XML configuration and processed by StreamPlugin
R305. Implements automatic conversion. Provide APIs to channel registry to register Payload conversion. Includes Redis and Rabbit transport.
R306. In a scenario where we are using the same job definition i.e. Job.xml and we create Job Instance Foo.  If I create and deploy Foo2 using Job.xml  I will see only 2 job definitions(correct), but I will see the job run 3 times.  If I create Foo3 & deploy, I will see 3 job definitions(correct), but the jobs will run 5 times.  
R307. Need to change the name from fixed-delay to fixed_delay or fixedDelay.  System rejects the '-'.
R308. We need a few steps  1. Investigate if we need to move off Spring Shell 1.0 dependency, e.g. need to use code in Spring Shell 2.0 branch  2. If we need to use code in Spring Shell 2.0 branch, we need to release a Spring Shell 1.1 M1 release with appropriate code changes.  Create stories related to Shell release.  3. Determine and document the basic recipe for doing integration tests.  4. Create stories to provide integration tests for each existing command
R309. Resource objects should be returned from all controller methods.  MVC Tests should be added to check returned values.
R310. See implementation used for Steams and apply to jobs, taps, triggers.
R311. See implementation used for Steams and apply to jobs, taps, triggers.
R312. Rename existing Tap class to something else.
R313. StreamController to not access the repository instance directly, all access to go through StreamDeployer  
R314. Favor using custom  exceptions instead of using Assert.notNull, review usage and make changes.  Eg. if a stream can't be found (or another definition) a 'XYZNotFoundException' instead of Assert.Null on the return value of a findOne method 
R315. To be consistent with Spring Data Repository method names.
R316. Only ‘create’ in TapDeployer has some additional code to check if the stream exists, could take place in another location.
R317. Save : Save a XYZDefinition - method used to be 'create'  Delete : Delete a XYZDefinition - method used to be called 'destroy'  Deploy : Deploy a XYZDefinition  Undeploy : Undeploy a XYZDefinition  List : List a XYZDefinition         Returns PagedResources<XYZDefinitionResource>  Display : Get specific information about a XYZDefinition    Create other stories for each Controller and include in this weeks sprint  
R318. DefaultFormattingConversionService provides Collection -> Object conversion which will produce the first item if the target type matches. Here, this results in an unfortunate side effect, getTuple(List<Tuple> list) would return a Tuple which is misleading. In this case it is preferable to treat it as an error if the argument is not a Tuple.
R319. Caused by that weird annotation dependency problem that I worked around for compile. But Sonar complains.    One solution would be to add Jackson 2 to the Sonar "classpath", but I did not manage to do that.    
R320. Current behavior is to just have a prompt of "unknown:>"  I think any return value of a @CliCommand method is not shown b/c the whole infrastructure is not up at that time
R321. 	public StreamPlugin(){ 		postProcessContextPath = CHANNEL_REGISTRY; 	}  Subclasses should not directly update superclass fields.
R322. Shell command to delete a trigger.     Note: this command will only remove the trigger definition not modifying the jobs that use the trigger.
R323. Also, if you deploy the Job it will fail, but then you can't delete the job.
R324. We need to determine where this information could fit in.  It can be either in "README" at the project home page or "Getting started" wiki page.
R325. XD-482 addresses the use of camel case in 'fixed-delay' job module parameter name. and, we need to fix the same for other module parameters wherever '-' is being used. 
R326. See XD-477
R327. See XD-477
R328. See XD-477
R329. the test for findAll often fails for me when running inside gradle. (Could not reproduce inside eclipse)    I already tried fixing it by using a different redis key space, but to no avail.  One explanation would be if gradle runs tests concurrently, but my understanding is that it does not.
R330. Add top level utility methods to manage XD runtime (deploy, start and stop). These methods will be used by underlying integration tests to control runtime test environment.  
R331. Since most of the xd.shell.itests will do more then one thing (deploy a stream, start it, add a tap, add a job, stop, etc) we decided to decouple writing testcases with running it. Test cases will be written in spring-shell scriptlets. Scriptlets are json files with command and expectedResult as tokens.  Here's an example:  {code} { "testscript":   [ {"command" : "stream create --definition "http | file" --name http2file",     "result" : "Created new stream 'http2file'"},    {"command" : "stream list",     "result" : "..."}  ] } {code}  A parser will parse scriptlets, executes it and asserts on expected results.   
R332. CI job will run integration tests that are tagged for CI build.
R333. Create proper test coverage for Controllers
R334. Currently, process is left running and if logs / sysout are not monitored, you have no clue
R335. Container currently does that.
R336. Standalone Admin currently has no shiny banner as container has. More importantly, it does not say which port it's listening on, the transport used, etc.
R337. We need to fail fast.
R338. Right now it treats it as a new parameter start and fails.
R339. From the shell:  {code} > stream create --name aaa --definition "time|log" Created new stream 'aaa'  > tap create --name aa --definition "tap aaa | log" Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: XD111E:(pos 8): Unexpected token.  Expected 'dot(.)' but was 'pipe(|)' tap aaa | log  >tap create --name aa --definition "tap aaa . log" Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: There is already a tap named 'aa' {code}  Looks like the first tap was created even though there was a parse error.  And so the second attempt to create the tap failed due to an existing tap.
R340. Tried to create a module named "tcp-poll" and got this:  XD108E:(pos 3): missing expected character '-'  tcp-poll --host=54.208.22.193 --port=8081 | log      I believe this should be supported, and indeed we have several module names of this form already
R341. Thinking about using the official SpringSource rules as a template
R342. Currently, living at the root of the project, those files don't benefit from IDE SI awareness.  Make it so that they belong to a java project which sees the correct version of the SI jars used.  Has impact on the build.gradle file
R343. Still keep existing one.
R344. Existing code: https://github.com/ghillert/springone2012
R345. create, delete, deploy streams...
R346. creating taps, deleting
R347. creating triggers, deleting triggers
R348. creating job defs, deploying jobs, undeploying jobs, deleting job defs
R349. This requires to boostrap the singlenode admin server in process, submit commands to the shell programmatically, and assert on the results of executing the command.
R350. Investigate using transactions and pipelining to improve performance of both the inbound and outbound RedisQueue channel adapters. Involves testing against a pre-release of SDR 1.1 M2.
R351. Use an 'undeploy' topic to broadcast undeploy requests to all containers.    Applies to Redis and Rabbit transports, not local.    Also, rename {{ModuleDeploymentRequest}} to {{ModuleOperationRequest}} with an enum {{DEPLOY}}, {{UNDEPLOY}}.
R352. Currently many methods take module, group, index - defining a module instance; group and index can be encapsulated in {{Module}} so one arg can be passed around.
R353. Most of the infrastructure and code cleanup has been done for In-Memory Analytics. The only remaining issue is that, by including memory-analytics.xml from common.xml, we're actually creating e.g. a new InMemoryCounterRepository that is different from the one present in the Admin process space.    This story involves fixing that. It may actually be done as part of XD-353, handling the "local" transport as a special case (context inheritance) rather than import based on xd.transport
R354. FieldValueCounterHandler was first written to support setting several fields at once, but the current constructor / field-value-counter.xml does not use it.  Either leverage that feature or simplify code
R355. {{stream list}} shell command should display status of the stream (deployed, undeployed)
R356. Seems like the current file source results from an initial POC. Very few things can be parameterized, including the polled directory that needs to be in /tmp/xxx  To be useful in production, we might want to revisit
R357. Split plugin module processing into pre and post processing where preprocessing is done before the context is refreshed and post processing is done after the refresh, but before the start.    In the Stream plugin, wire the module into the {{ChannelRegistry}} during post processing, instead of using the {{ChannelRegistrar}}.
R358. the top-level URL works via simple curl (without an Accept header) or the browser:    {code}  > curl http://localhost:8080    {"links":[{"rel":"streams","href":"http://localhost:8080/streams"},{"rel":"triggers","href":"http://localhost:8080/triggers"},{"rel":"jobs","href":"http://localhost:8080/jobs"},{"rel":"taps","href":"http://localhost:8080/taps"},{"rel":"counters","href":"http://localhost:8080/metrics/counters"}]}  {code}    However, trying any of those links then fails, e.g.:    {code}  > curl http://localhost:8080/streams    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?><errors xmlns:ns2="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"><error logref="HttpMessageNotWritableException"><message>Could not marshal [PagedResource { content: [links: [&lt;http://localhost:8080/streams/mqttdemo&gt;;rel=&quot;self&quot;]], metadata: Metadata { number: 0, total pages: 1, total elements: 1, size: 20 }, links: [] }]: null; nested exception is javax.xml.bind.MarshalException   - with linked exception:  [com.sun.istack.internal.SAXException2: unable to marshal type &quot;org.springframework.xd.rest.client.domain.StreamDefinitionResource&quot; as an element because it is not known to this context.]</message></error></errors>  {code}  
R359. XD instances will not accept xhr requests from browsers whose page origin does not match the XD instance.      As an example, the Kodiak UI is served from a different process (and url) than the XD instance.  When users open the Kodiak UI in a browser, requests from the browser to the XD instance, but these requests will fail due to cross-site scripting limitations.    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a way to get around this.  We can configure the server to accept requests from browsers whose origins are not the XD instance.    I have this working in a local branch and will submit a pull request.      More information:  CORS Spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/  SPR-9278 CORS support for SpringFramework  
R360. It seems the html rendering of documentation is using a variable width font for some of the code (esp. [source,sh] apparently) rendering.  Weird thing though is that when mouse hovering over some of them, they went back to fixed width. See screenshot.  http://static.springsource.org/spring-xd/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/#_start_the_runtime_and_the_xd_shell 
R361. There is some overlap between the gauge and counter repository types and also between the domain resources used by the REST controllers (CounterResource, GaugeResource). The aggregate counter may wish to return a simple count value for the counter too, which would also be a simple integral value.
R362. After XD-554 the ModuleJobExecutor.start does not get called.  Thus jobs that are "run one time" do not fire.
R363. reproduce  1) Create a bad stream definition name 'bad'  Try to recreate with the same name, but correct stream definitions.  The system will report that the stream already exists.    
R364. make sure nothing is broken - spot check using.    1) ticktock  2) twitter  3) gemfire      
R365. Show how to select a specific hadoop distribution when starting embedded/standalone XDContainer.
R366. Create a reproducible series of steps or shell integration test.  
R367. Expected usage (ATM) would be    // sink channel called foo  http | transform --expression=payload.toUppercase() > :foo  // source channel called foo  :foo > count | file
R368. e.g. http://localhost:8080:>post httpsource --target http://localhost:9090 --data 10    I believe this will also help to avoid ugly syntax to escaping quotes for json as in the gemfire example.
R369. The current http command is of the form    http://localhost:8080:>post httpsource --target http://localhost:9090 --data 10      It isn't intuitive to think 'post', rather the command can be     http post --target http://localhost:9090 --data 10    which will allow us to have support for other http verbs and cleanly separate the namespace from 'hadoop' etc.    The RestShell from which this came was only concerned with http actions, so the leading command classification probably seemed superfluous.  
R370. http://localhost:8080:>hadoop config fs --namenode webhdfs://localhost:50070  http://localhost:8080:>hadoop fs ls /  Hadoop configuration changed, re-initializing shell...  run HDFS shell failed. Message is: org/mortbay/util/ajax/JSON    This was on a hadoop 1.0.1 install    The hdfs http interface was available    $ curl -i "http://localhost:50070/webhdfs/v1/tmp?op=GETFILESTATUS"  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  Content-Type: application/json  Transfer-Encoding: chunked  Server: Jetty(6.1.26)    {"FileStatus":{"accessTime":0,"blockSize":0,"group":"supergroup","length":0,"modificationTime":1365015846724,"owner":"mpollack","pathSuffix":"","permission":"777","replication":0,"type":"DIRECTORY"}}  
R371. From https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/pull/161:  "The command shell needs to also support different hadoop distribution options. Perhaps the shell just uses a relative path to the location of xd/lib/"
R372. results in both in-memory and redis based definitions of RichGaugeService - can't satisfy autowiring because there are two candidates.  Had to change --analytics=memory to get the application context to load.
R373. Sending data to an incomplete stream which is created using a named sink channel only works when using Redis (or Rabbit?, not tested). Since the in-memory version doesn't use a queue, it will fail if you are using xd-singlenode.    We should use a queue channel with unlimited capacity to allow messages to be sent before the full stream is created.
R374. This has been observed intermittently with Redis transport by myself and others when sending a message to a valid stream. Not sure how to recreate it yet.    11:27:10,082 ERROR ThreadPoolTaskScheduler-1 redis.RedisQueueInboundChannelAdapter:126 - Error sending message  org.springframework.integration.MessageDeliveryException: Dispatcher has no subscribers for channel 'org.springframework.context.support.GenericApplicationContext@3f73865d.input'.  
R375. The upgrade to Jackson 2.2 included the following change to the build script  {code}  project('spring-xd-dirt') {  	description = 'Spring XD DIRT'  	configurations {  	  [runtime,testRuntime]*.exclude group: 'org.codehaus.jackson'  	}  {code}    Spring social twitter template depends on these classes  
R376. Both Luke's original code and my refactored PR[1] (which uses same code snippet) seem to behave strangely.    Stored values seem fine, but the getCounts() method seems phony.    To test:  1) stream create foo --definition "time|log"  2) tap create bar --definition "tap@foo | aggregatecounter"  3) curl -H "application/json" http://localhost:8080/metrics/aggregate-counters/bar    this gives default bucketing (hourly) but chances are that they are empty. 
R377. Keep track of named streams that were create and use @After to destroy them.
R378. The current flow of gradle tasks is confusing.  Suggest the following changes to simplify the flow.    1. Move the current task logic in zipXD to distZip  2. Have distZip depend on dist  3. Update the 'how to build docs' on the wiki  4. Make sure that the distZip task only shows up once in the list of gradle target. 
R379. Start of a test program that can be placed in StreamCommandTests:    {code}  @Test  public void testTappingAndChannels() {    executeStreamCreate("myhttp","http --port=9314 | transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | log",true);    executeStreamCreate("tap","tap @myhttp.1 | log",true);		    executeStreamCreate("tap_new","tap myhttp.1 > log",true);				    executeCommand("http post --data Dracarys! --target http://localhost:9314");    // TODO verify both logs output DRACARYS!  }    {code}    In the test program see two taps. One using the older style and one using the newer style and '>' so that there is no real tap module source, the log module just gets its input channel wired directly to myhttp.1 (the output of transform).  They should be doing the same thing.  However when run the output for tap_new is missing, all I see is:    {code}  11:39:36,055  WARN New I/O worker #28 logger.tap:141 - DRACARYS!  11:39:36,059  WARN New I/O worker #28 logger.myhttp:141 - DRACARYS!  {code}    No errors are reported, there is just no output for tap_new.
R380. Add "counter delete" shell command. This also requires implementation of DELETE rest end point at CountersController.
R381. We need to add list/delete commands for the metrics:    InMemoryAggregateCounter  FieldValueCounter  Gauge  RichGauge    Currently, the AbstractMetricsController class has the delete method to delete the metric from the repository. We can probably use the same for all the metrics.
R382. We need to fix the github wiki to use the xd shell command prompt "xd:>".
R383. Add CONTRIBUTING.md file, use the Spring Integration file as the basis.
R384. When running an ad-hoc job without the use of a trigger (adhoc or named).  The user has to wait for job to complete before receiving a success.  We need to launch a job and get a success back to the user letting them know the job has been launched.    for example --immediate
R385. Need to investigate why this is happening, normally setting   {code:xml}  <gfe:client-cache close="false"/>  {code}  prevents the (singleton) cache from closing when the application context is closed. 
R386. When importing Spring-XD as a gradle project, in STS, while building the model, we get    Root exception:  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Project location doesn't exist:   .../spring-xd/spring-xd-hadoop/hadoop11    ./gradlew eclipse creates these directories, but the plugin needs them before running that task    The problem seems to be that these "projects" are not really projects.    Perhaps a quick fix would be to commit these directories (with a dummy file) ??

R389. The RichGauge section does not mention the "alpha" parameter in redis output, nor does it explain its meaning.
R390. This may be an issue following the search/replace from curl to Shell, but for example, this documentation line does not work:    http post --target http://localhost:9000 --data "{\"symbol\":\"VMW\",\"price\":72.04}"    The backslash prior to quote is left in the payload (and hence Jackson chokes on it)    We need clear rules about quoting at the shell level
R391. http://static.springsource.org/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/#sources    should have 'rabbit' added to the list and also the corresponding section that shows some basic usage.

R394. https://github.com/springsource/spring-xd/wiki/Sinks    should have 'rabbit' added to the list and also the corresponding section that shows some basic usage.
R395. When using Redis store, stored deployed streams should be deployed on container restart.
R396. Content-Type during transport transit is not the same as the content-type within modules.    "Real" transports always use byte[] which may contain raw byte[] from a source, a byte[] converted from a String (which may or may not already contain JSON), or a byte[] containing JSON converted by the transport on the outbound side.    The transport needs to convey which of these was applied on the outbound side so it can properly reconstruct the message.    Retain any content-type header that already exists in the message, and restore it.    For Rabbit, use normal SI/Rabbit headers to convey this information.    For Redis, add the information to the byte[].
R397. when automating tests for creating http|hdfs stream, I run into an issue where CommandResult object always set success=true even if the actual hadoop shell command fail.  == valid hdfs url getShell().executeCommand("hadoop config fs --namenode hdfs://localhost:8020"); CommandResult cr = getShell().executeCommand("hadoop fs ls /");  == output Found 2 items drwxr-xr-x   - administrator supergroup          0 2013-08-05 17:18 /user drwxr-xr-x   - administrator supergroup          0 2013-08-05 17:18 /xd  CommandResult [success=true, result=null, exception=null]  == invalid hdfs url getShell().executeCommand("hadoop config fs --namenode hdfs://localhost:8021"); CommandResult cr = getShell().executeCommand("hadoop fs ls /");  == output Bad connection to FS. command aborted. exception: Call to localhost/127.0.0.1:8021 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused CommandResult [success=true, result=null, exception=null]  Ideally, we should set success=false if hadoop command fail and if hadoop command succeeds, we should set success=true and populate result= output from hadoop command instead of result=null

R399. Model the API more akin to SpringXDOperations api.
R400. Currently, you have to set the default name node every time your start the shell. We should do 2 things:   - Provide a default Name node Set Default Hadoop Name Node for Shell: hdfs://localhost:8020 - Should we provide some form of persistence? It kind of sucks that you have to re-specify the name node every time the shell starts up  {code} xd:>hadoop fs ls / You must set fs URL before run fs commands {code}

R402. currently, we can specify any bogus url using 'hadoop config fs --namenode' without any warning.  e.g. hadoop config fs --namenode hdfs://localhost:8888  doing a 'hadoop fs ls /' will catch the error and throw exception. Ideally, we should catch the bogus url error early in the 'hadoop config fs' command. similar to 'admin config server --uri'
R403. WARN log emitted because the embedded connection factory does not get an application event publisher.    Will be fixed in SI M3 (INT-3107).
R404. The *http post* command uses the default MediaType by the RestTemplate, which in return triggers the default *StringHttpMessageConverter* which itself uses the default charset *ISO-8859-1*.    This creates issues when posting special characters.
R405. Run the shell command {{stream list}} and you get the following error:  {code} xd:>stream list Command failed org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageNotReadableException: Could not read JSON: Unrecognized field "metadata" (class org.springframework.xd.rest.client.domain.StreamDefinitionResource$Page), not marked as ignorable (3 known properties: , "links", "content", "page"])  at [Source: sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection$HttpInputStream@30721965; line: 1, column: 148] (through reference chain: org.springframework.xd.rest.client.domain.Page["metadata"]); nested exception is com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field "metadata" (class org.springframework.xd.rest.client.domain.StreamDefinitionResource$Page), not marked as ignorable (3 known properties: , "links", "content", "page"])  at [Source: sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection$HttpInputStream@30721965; line: 1, column: 148] (through reference chain: org.springframework.xd.rest.client.domain.Page["metadata"]) {code}  You get a similar error when running any of the following:  {code} tap list trigger list job list {code}
R406. {code} mystream = http | transform --payload=expression.toUpperCase() > :foo tap mystream.transform | log {code} This appears to fail because we can't tap into whatever was created to represent the named channel 'foo'. There is an @Ignore test in StreamCommandTests called testTappingModulesVariationsWithSinkChannel() which checks this.  (The parser is currently resolving 'tap mystream.transform' to 'tap --channel=foo'.)
R407. There are some asserts in StreamCommandTests that are commented out (see the TODOs in there). These asserts are verifying the contents of the various sinks employed in the tests. I am finding that if the tests are run all together with the asserts enabled (run all StreamCommandTests), some of the assertions fail, with something like:    {code}  org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<[DRACARYS!  ]> but was:<[]>    org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:115)    org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:144)    {code}    When run individually the tests succeed. Not sure if it is timing (checking sinks before they've been written to) or something else...
R408. The classes under test are pluralized. Therefore, the test classes themselves should reflect that. E.g. rename *JobCommandTests* to *JobCommandsTests* as it tests class *JobCommands*. Please check all tests in that package for correct naming.
R409. E.g. allow for posting of JSON data stored in local files.    * Allow users to specify the *content-type*.  * Ensure that Unicode data (UTF) posts correctly.
R410. Consistency with JMS Source.
R411. Spring Xd currently ships with Guava 12.0 while Hadoop 2.0.5 and Pivotal HD 1.0 depends on 11.0.2 - this could lead to classpath problems if we include both.
R412. pollers should standardize on fixed-delay vs fixed-rate. The value should accept a property with a standard name like 'interval'
R413. The {{AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler}} in the Rabbit transport exposes the internal transport content-type, if none existed on the original transported message.
R414. Factor out common Redis/Rabbit {{ChannelRegistry}} code.  Also, factor out common inbound/tap code (very similar).  Change transport nternals to Use AbstractTransformer instead of {{ARPMH}} and {{BridgeHandler}}.
R415. When using the shell, I forgot to configure the Hadoop URL via "hadoop config fs --namenode hdfs://pivhdsne:8020"  I then did: xd:>hadoop fs ls /xd/tweets You must set fs URL before run fs commands  The error message should tell me how to set the URL (via the hadoop config command). I had to go back to the documentation to figure it out. It's also not entirely grammatically correct.
R416. I had the following interaction with the shell. It does work if I do "hadoop fs rm /xd/tweets --recursive". Either the order shouldn't matter or the doc should be more clear on placement of the option.  xd:>hadoop fs rm /xd/tweets To remove directory, please use fs rm --recursive instead xd:>hadoop fs rm --recursive /xd/tweets java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Failed to convert '/xd/tweets' to type boolean for option 'recursive' Cannot convert /xd/tweets to type Boolean. 
R417. Trying to use xd-container with PHD, and therefore need to start with --hadoopDistro. I get the following error:    $ bin/xd-container --hadoopDistro phd1  17:11:20,305 ERROR main server.ContainerMain:59 - "--hadoopDistro" is not a valid option  
R418. This is a follow on from XD-592. In that bug we fixed up the ability to use tap with pipe.  Tap when used as a source channel should also work (and should deploy in a more optimized fashion since source channels can be directly connected to the subsequent module, creation of a pass-through tap instance isn't necessary).  This test shows the syntax that should work and the current information about how it fails:  {code} public void testTapSourceChannel() throws IOException {   FileSink sink1 = newFileSink();   FileSink sink2 = newFileSink();    stream().create("myhttp",     "http --port=9314 | transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | filter --expression=true > :foo");    // fails with: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: bean 'myhttp.1' is already   // registered but does not match the required type   tap().create("wiretap1", "tap myhttp.transform > transform --expression=payload.replaceAll('a','.') | %s", sink1);    // fails in TapDefinition ctor with: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:   // streamName cannot be empty or null   tap().create("wiretap2", "tap :foo > transform --expression=payload.replaceAll('a','.') | %s", sink2);    httpPostData("http://localhost:9314", "Dracarys!"); } {code}  I suspect part of the problem initially lies with the code around EnhancedStreamParser that builds the module deployment requests from the Ast parsed from the input DSL string.  Whether a source channel was originally specified with 'tap' is captured in that Ast but that knowledge doesn't appear to be getting used.  
R419. Figure 1 here https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/wiki/Architecture should also show Rabbit as an option, since otherwise people will think we are tied to redis.
R420. We need to add support for matching column names with underscores like "user_name" and map them to camel case style keys like "userName" in the JdbcMessagePayloadTransformer.
R421. I modified rabbit.hostname in rabbit.properties and xd-container still attempted to find Rabbit at localhost with --transport rabbit. Looks like the PPC for xd-container and xd-admin is not pointing to rabbit.properties
R422. Need to undo the recent add of rabbit.properties to xd-common.xml. Tried to work around this by configuring rabbit-container with only the PPC it needs (pointing to only rabbit.properties), but this caused issues with redis-analytics later requiring redis.properties. Would be nice to have a way for redis-analytics to contribute redis.properties or something similar...   Also, strictly speaking, the local admin server does not even need redis.properties, let alone rabbit.properties, so we should find a cleaner way to configure this.
R423. support of the alpha parameter is awkward and can confuse people who are expecting a simple average mean.  Consider splitting RichGauge in two flavors: arithmetic and exponential.  Involves quite some work at the repository, handler and REST level though... 
R424. Current implementation converts to a String.    See if we can emit raw payload (given that we also emit content-type header)    Setting to 8 points, as this may have lots of implications down the line though
R425. As we overwrote changes to file source by mistake, let's add some regression tests, esp. to the file location.    Plan on extending the utility source and sink functionality
R426. This will come back in M3 once we iron out the issues.
R427. After running gradle -> refresh source folders on the spring-xd-module project in Eclipse, there is an error because the {{src/test/java}} folder is missing.    Solution is to add a placeholder file.
R428. Any kind of sophisticated artifact retrieval mechanism in XD will need to grab more than one kind of artifact at once.  For example, if I want to see all taps, streams, triggers, and jobs (ie- everything), I need to make 4 http requests.  I can imagine dashboards that need to display information on artifacts of multiple kinds.  There will also need to be a way to pass a query to return a sub-set of artifacts, but that should be designed separately.
R429. The doc says the name option is "the absolute path to the directory to monitor for files" but it actually seems to be the name of a dir in /tmp/xd/input. Not sure which is the correct behavior. Also, "name" as an option name seems a little vague. Maybe something like "--directory"?    Also, if I set --duplicates=true, it actually prevents duplicates (setting prevents-duplicates to true)
R430. Allow Json payloads from external sources, e.g., http post to contain single quoted field names and values. This is required where XD uses Jackson to convert payloads from Json to object or Tuples.
R431. Instead of     xd:>http post --target http://localhost:9898 --data "hello world"  > POST (text/plain;charset=UTF-8) http://localhost:9898 hello world  > 200 OK  > Content-Length: 0  > Connection: keep-alive  >   Success sending data 'hello world' to target 'http://localhost:9898'      have    xd:>http post --target http://localhost:9898 --data "hello world"  > POST (text/plain;charset=UTF-8) http://localhost:9898 hello world  > 200 OK      or better yet    xd:>http post --target http://localhost:9898 --data "hello world"  > 200 OK POST (text/plain;charset=UTF-8) http://localhost:9898 hello world             
R432. Consider 2 Admins/Containers that are using discrete Redis instances but a shared Rabbit instance for the transport.    If two different streams are deployed on each, but with the same stream name, the Rabbit queues will be common (e.g. foo.0), causing crosstalk.    Stream names must be unique across all container instances sharing Rabbit infrastructure.    I am not sure what the solution is; two instances of the *same* stream *do* need common queues but instances of different streams need a qualifier of some kind (container name?). I guess it's not *that* big of an issue because, if they're sharing infrastructure, they're likely to be sharing a stream repo too - in which case you'd need unique stream names.
R433. Remove the {{NoOpRedisSerializer}} and use the non-serialization feature of M2.
R434. I see the following output on the shell if I create a job and reference a non-existent trigger. There's a big stack trace in the server log, but nothing on the shell side indicating failure. A subsequent "jobs list" also shows the job. The same thing happens if I deploy an undeployed Job after deleting its associated Trigger.    $ job create --name helloWorldJob --definition "myjob --trigger=nonexistenttrigger"  Successfully created and deployed job 'helloWorldJob'
R435. Keep getting the following warning:    WARN Spring Shell conf.Configuration:817 - fs.default.name is deprecated. Instead, use fs.defaultFS    Should switch to use the runtime value of the FS_DEFAULT_NAME_KEY constant based on Hadoop version used.
R436. It would be nice to have "lastHours" and "lastDays" options for aggregatecounter display command.
R437. Redis transport headers are not removed in taps.
R438. Currently, the initial tap module accepted media types are not retrieved from the module when creating the tap.
R439. The Rest-Client project should not impose Joda to the user.
R440. Not only should it not use Joda (see XD-668) but the passing of dates currently relies on default formatting
R441. Provide Shell TAB completion when referencing an existing entity
R442. It should be possible to create streams like the following which rely upon named channel support and dynamic routing capabilities:    {code}  http | somerouter  :x > xtransformer | hdfs  :y > ytransformer | hdfs  {code}    The 'somerouter' processor could return "x" or "y" which determines the downstream path for each message.    This should be implemented in such a way that any developer adding a router module would only need to deal with existing Spring Integration semantics (in this case, only considering the return of "x" or "y" - whether it be SpEL or a POJO method invocation). Perhaps in the plugin that modifies a module context, we could simply add a new ChannelResolver implementation (by adding that ChannelResolver as a bean and/or a BeanPostProcessor that configures that as the resolver for any router, if necessary). That ChannelResolver would have a reference to the ChannelRegistry so that the router actually sends its messages to those shared channels. The shared channels themselves would have been created as long as a valid downstream flow has been defined.
R443. should go thru the list of all commands available and make sure that a simple "not connected" message is returned instead of something like this:  {code} org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on GET request for "http://localhost:8080":Unexpected end of file from server; nested exception is java.net.SocketException: Unexpected end of file from server     at org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate.doExecute(RestTemplate.java:498) .... {code} 
R444. the value for --target is required (there is no default), but the hint for that option states otherwise:  {code} xd:>http post --target http post --target required --target: the location to post to; default if option not present: 'http://localhost:9000' {code} 
R445. Because StringToJsonNodeTransformer expects a String as input, one cannot chain json related processors.    A simple solution would be to also accept Jackson IN and forward it directly in that case.
R446. Example using name:    {code}  filter --expression="payload.myfield.startsWith('foo')"  {code}    Example using index:    {code}  filter --expression="payload.2.startsWith('foo')"  {code}    This should support nested keys as well:    {code}  filter --expression="payload.myfield.subfield.startsWith('foo')"  {code}  
R447. xd:>tap destroy mytap  16:44:41,850  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:524 - DELETE request for "http://localhost:8080/taps/mytap" resulted in 400 (Bad Request); invoking error handler  Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: XD116E:(pos 4): unrecognized stream reference 'foo'  tap foo.http | log    Tap is then still listed when I do a "tap list"
R448. Please put in suggestions for the current .settings file.  Maybe one suggestion is to not format on save?
R449. This example should require no code. Just the basic XML.
R450. The expression currently appends "." + ${suffix} (where the default suffix is 'out').    If the suffix value were an empty String, this would lead to the file name ending with a dot. We should update the expression so that it only appends the dot if the suffix is not empty. This might be possible with a ternary expression.
R451. also, the current behavior is broken; it checks if the property is set but does not actually check whether it's true or false
R452. Taps are currently source modules.    They could be refactored to simply bridge the tapped module's tap pub/sub topic directly (with conversion) to the first tap module's input channel.    Note - ensure destroy works. Currently the tap is destroyed by the simple fact it is a module; if it's no longer a module we'll need special handling to stop/remove the tap adapter.
R453. Provide some syntax allowing multiple tap points to be directed to a named channel.    e.g.   tap foo.4 > namedTap  tap bar.2 > namedTap    or    :tap.foo > counter
R454. xd:>stream create --name testgemfire --definition "http --port=8887 | gemfire"   16:20:28,503  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:524 - POST request for "http://localhost:8080/streams" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanDefinitionStoreException: Invalid bean definition with name 'region' defined in null: Could not resolve placeholder 'regionName' in string value "${regionName}"
R455. stream create --name test1 --definition "http --port=8827 | gemfire-server" Created new stream 'test1'  stream create --name test2 --definition "http --port=8828 | gemfire-json-server" Created new stream 'test2'  even if gemfire server is not started, streams are successfully created. This behavior is inconsistent with hdfs where if hdfs connection is not available, creating stream using 'http | hdfs' will fail.  
R456.   String -> byte[] (string.getBytes())   byte[] -> byte[] (no serialization)  Pojo -> configured serialization    
R457. AbstractDeployer has 4 subclasses, 3 of which override e.g. deploy() making the boilerplate factorization ineffective.    Introduce an intermediate class for those deployers that support the concept of an instance (Stream, Tap, Job to some extent)
R458. Make the default value of enableJmx false until we have tested/documented JMX functionality
R459. we should check the actual deployment requests were built correctly for each module in the testCreateUndeployAndDeleteOfStream test.  Currently we just use the anyListOf check.
R460. Spring Data Redis 1.1 M2 added the ability to use RedisTemplate with binary data. We should switch to that instead of the no-op serializer we were forced to implement previously.
R461. Automate running integration tests on all supported transports
R462. When trying to undeploy/destroy a tap that has reference to an already deleted stream fails with the following exception: Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: XD116E:(pos 4): unrecognized stream reference '<stream_name at the tap defintion>'.  As expected, the StreamConfigParser's lookupStream fails to find the stream name as the stream doesn't exist in the repository.   In this scenario, what is a better way to handle the tap operations.  Should we undeploy the tap when the stream is destroyed? ( though I don't see an easy way to find the taps that use a specific stream).
R463. Remove   <bean id="idGenerator" class="org.springframework.xd.dirt.container.UUIDGenerator" />  (container.xml)    Delete org.springframework.xd.dirt.container.UUIDGenerator  remove compile dependency on eaio from build.gradle
R464. After an initial attempt which was not ready for M2 we are rethinking our strategy. One of the fundamental things we have come to realize is that its important to treat serialization and type conversion as separate concerns.  Serialization:  A core principle is the consumer should by default receive exactly what the producer sent:    -   If the producer sends a byte[] payload then no serialization is required.      -   A String payload can use simple byte conversion, taking the Charset into account    -  Transporting an Object uses whatever serialization is configured (json, xml, avro, protocol buffer, java.io, msgpack, etc.).   The actual serialization performed for each message must be shared with the producer and consumer. I.e., the consumer needs to know which case above applies to each payload. Currently we are using the MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE defining custom mime types for this (The designated header is subject to change)  Conversion:     - The consumer optionally defines one or more content-types (read MimeType) it can accept in order of preference. If no conversion succeeds, we can either give them the byte[] payload or throw an exception (configurable?).  Examples:  - Consumer accepts a Java Object (application/x-java-object;type=example.Foo).  Assume for simplicity, the consumer may send a JSON String, or a Foo.  On the receiving end we need to distinguish a String payload containing a JSON representation of Foo from a serialized Foo payload. If the payload is a String, we need to know that its original content is application/json. We are currently using a 2nd "original-content-type" message header to supply this information.  So in the first case we have (conceptually) content-type: "XD plain text" , original-content-type "application/json".  In the second case we have content-type: "XD Serialized JSON" original-content-type not used in this case since the serialized JSON includes type information (using Jackson conventions which are a bit brittle).   -If the producer type is different from the accepted type, we use the conversion service and the consumer must register appropriate converters.   A twist for XD that may be generally relevant is that some optimization is possible when we know the bytes represent JSON:  -  Tuple conversion:  Since we serialize using JSON and we know how to transform JSON <->Tuple,  we can convert any Object  payload or any JSON String to a Tuple.  We can avoid the two step deserialization+conversion,  e.g.   1) Foo->JSON->Foo 2) Foo->Tuple.

R466. The current code is creating an in-memory job repository for each batch job that is launched.  This makes it impossible to query the tables in the job repository across the cluster.  A single job repository that is backed by a file need to be shared across all jobs that are a launched.    *Implementation Suggestions*  * The XDAdmin server should create the job repository schema, if not found, in a HSQLDB database, when it starts up  * The bean definitions should be added to the same context that the analytics are being loaded in as it is already shared across xd-admin/xd-container.  The ‘analytics’ context should be renamed to something more generic, ‘shared parent context’ or something.  * There is some clean up (removal) of the code in the current JobPlugin, META-INF/spring-xd/plugins/job/common.xml wouldn’t be needed anymore.  That might be all, not sure.    *How to verify it works*  * A JUnit test that verifies the spring batch tables were created in the job repository when xd-admin is launched.  This would require deleting the backing db file before instantiating singlenode/xd-admin/xd-container.    * If you start the xd-container it should be able to find the necessary DataSource/JobRepository beans information to be able to contact the database.  We don’t have DI style JUnit tests so this will required getting a reference to the xd-container and it’s application context, and performing ‘getBean(JobRepository.class)’        
R467. Need to support Rabbit virtual host property in properties file and as args to Rabbit source and sink
R468. *Description*  When a job is ‘created’ in SpringXD, a ‘control-channel’ for that job is also created.  The listener for that channel will receive a message, be able to take the ‘jobParameters’ and other launch information from the message, and be able to launch/run the job.    NOTE: I can see a few other stories that should probably be made to break this up after writing it. I put estimate of 10 for now, but we should break this up.  Here are some suggestions    1. create ‘data only’ JobParametersBean equivalent with primitive types  2. create jobLauncher source  3. create jobParameterTransformer processor  4. Refactoring of ChannelRegistry’s aliasHing to use a callback strategy.      *Implementation Suggestions*    job create --name helloWorldJob --definition "myjob --somePropertyToOverride=someValue    * This would not execute the batch job immediately, but instead register the job definition and deploys a “jobLauncher�? and the job definition to an XD-Container.    * The XD-Container that receives the deploy request message will create a module application context, will also create a channel with the Channel registry named after the job, e.g. :myJob.  This should be a pub/sub channel from the point of view of the middleware.  From the point of view of the spring integration channel, it should ideally be of the executor channel.  There is a limitation in the current implementation of ChannelRegistry now as ‘createInbound’ only creates direct channels.  The boolean ‘aliasHint’ should probably be extended to some type of callback that creates a channel.  The aliasHint was added to address the case of LocalChannelRegistry creating or looking up a queue backed channel or a direct channel.  There will be a consumer on the SI channel in the module application context that will be responsible for getting the job launch information and launching the job.  The launching of the job may need to be explicitly done in a separate thread if direct channels are created by the ChannelRegistry.  The contents of the message should be something similar to the current “JobParametersBean�?, it needs to be easily serializable with simple types via JSON over the wire.  The current impl of “JobParametersBean�? has ObjectMapper, so that may require a bit of reworking.  The handler of the message will use the jobLauncher to launch the job, using the information in the JobParametersBean.    * The ‘myjob’ can then be launched by sending a message, perhaps this is handled by having a jobLauncher source    jobLauncher [--jobParameters <jobParameters>] [--dateFormat <dateFormat>] [--numberFormat <numberFormat>] [--makeUnique <makeUnique>]  > :myJob    e.g. with no-args    jobLauncher  > :myJob    *How to verify it works*    With the test HelloSpringXDTasklet, we should be able to create the job    job create --name helloSpringXD --definition "myjob"    This will not launch the job (as mentioned in the ‘implementation’ section.    It would then be launched by     jobLauncher  > :myJob    where jobLauncher is a new source.    Ideally would like to be able to test a data driven triggering.  This would require a new file source that doesn’t use the file-to-string-transformer, but lets a File object be the payload.    file | jobParameterTransformer > :myJob  
R469. Control transport - Deploy/Undeploy requests  Message transport - Inter module communication    Currently complicated because starting a Job for example currently uses message transport vs control transport. Testing scenarios require local control and ability to switch to various message transports.    One option is to change the interpretation of transport command line arg depending on SingleNode, Admin, or Container. e.g.  SingleNode --transport rabbit (always use local for control messages)  Admin (requires --transport, message transport does not apply)  Container (enforces the same transport for message and control. Local optimization done via composite module)    The other option is use a separate transport for control vs messages.   Either way need to rationalize the design with respect to control and module messages  
R470. SingleNodeMain(){    	parent = new AC(..)     		AdminMain.launch(parent);     		ContainerMain.launch(parent);  }    This should make startup processing more consistent and symmetrical  
R471. Upgrade Lettuce to 2.3.3 and subsequently Netty to 3.6.6
R472. A change was made in spring-data-redis to instantiate the shared Lettuce connection lazily instead of when the context is initialized. This caused TapCommandTests to hang due to a Netty worker thread trying to initialize the Lettuce connection (Lettuce uses Netty). The change was temporarily backed out of SDR, but we need to consider using a NettyExecutionHandler in NettyHttpInboundChannelAdapter or making the HTTP module's "input" channel an ExecutorChannel to avoid potentially long operations like from happening in an I/O thread.    Also, we need to address why this failure simply hangs the shell.

R474. The ParentLastClassloader is located in the spring-hadoop project.  It will resolve classes first looking at the child context and then the parent.  This works well for XD since the we want and dependencies of the module to be considered first and if not found, resolve against the parent. It would be possible to even include other versions of .jars already in the parent classloaders (e.g. Spring Integration jars), but for now, we will not immediately test that case.    SimpleModule needs to change to that we can pass in the classloader to use for creating the application context. The current implementation creates a GenericApplicationContext as a field initializer...that should change to be in the ctor.    ModuleDeployer should implement .BeanClassLoaderAware.  The classloader passed in to the BeanClassLoaderAware callback will be used as the ‘parent’ when creating the ParentLastClassloader.      The URL[] to pass into ParentLastClassloader should be ‘null’ or an empty array in this case of an older style module.  (Hopefully ParentLastClassloader  allows that type of fallback).    *Implementation Suggestions:*  The ModuleDeployer code is where the application context for the module is defined and instantiated.   Here is a possible impl path.    1. Assuming we can always use ParentLastClassloader (even for older style modules), then the ModuleDescriptor needs to return an array of URL[] locations for the module, getURL().  This is passed into the cto for SimpleModule.  The ctor then creates a new application context, creates the parentclassloader, sets the classloader on the application context and then proceeds as normal.   2.AbstractModuleRegistry should try and load the resource from two possible locations, e.g.     ./modules/source/file/config/file.xml    or    ./modules/source/file.xml    The module registry needs to be a bit smarter to know, ah, i see a config directory, let me try ./config/file.xml otherwise just ./file.xml      *How to verify it works.*    1. JUnit test in which one of the ModuleRegistry implementations points to a test directory that contains both old and new style modules.  FileModuleRegistry is probably a good choice here.  Need to test that the new getting for URL[] works as expected.    2. Existing tests should run as they did before, in particular the shell integration tests.
R475. Convert a simple module, such as file, to further test that what was done in the previous story, “Use ParentLastClassLoader to create the Modules ApplicationContext.�? works as expected.    *Implementation Suggestions*    Remove from build.gradle the dependency on spring-integration-file and place that jar inside a directory    ./modules/source/file/lib     place the current file.xml inside ./modules/source/file/config    *How to verify it works.*    1. Running tests that currently use the file source, e.g. in spring shell, should work as before  2. When deploying a stream file | log, we should be able to interrogate the channel registry and make sure it found the dependencies for the module, ModuleDescriptor should have a not-null URL[] property.
R476. After the xd-singlenode process has started, create a new module that has dependencies not already in the parent application context, and then create a stream that uses the new module.    *Implementation Suggestions*  Develop in the test tree, maybe of the xd-shell project, a new module.  the lib and config should be sititng around in a directory waiting to be copied into the appropriate spot.    Could try http://www.date4j.net/..The config file  would be similar to time.xml but use the date4j class.    *How to verify it works*  In a JUnit test case copy in a new module that has new dependencies, ..copy the lib and config directories into the location where the ModuleRegisty will pick it up.    Deploy a new stream, date4j | file and see if there are contents in the file.  
R477. After the xd-singlenode process has started, create a new job that has dependencies not already in the parent application context, and then create and run a new job that uses the new module.    *Implementation Suggestions*  Develop in the test tree, we can put in the jar and config from https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd-samples/tree/master/batch-simple     *How to verify it works.*  In a JUnit test case copy in a new job that has new dependencies, ..copy the lib and config directories into the location where the ModuleRegisty will pick it up.    Deploy a new job and check in the job repository that the job ran and was successful.    
R478. This is the other side of launching a job by sending a message.  The Job plugin should add listeners at the job/step level so that the job/step context information can be sent out on a channel.    :myjob.notifications is a suggested channel name that would be created automatically.
R479. There are a lot of Thread.sleep() calls with delays chosen in the 1-2 seconds range.  Change to a while loop with smaller pauses until a timeout is reached and give up.  This applies to verification code (e.g. verifying that a counter has expected value) as well as File setup, or http being ready to accept requests etc
R480. Register the module under test and deploy the module  Verify output across all transports  Examples  Be able to start the rabbitmq source just by pointing to modules/source/rabbit.xml, pass in some property file for parameters to be replaced, and outgoing message is placed in a in-memory queue backed channel for use with assertions to verify functionality.  Test that sending json, results in media-type header is set to json  Test that sending POJO -> POJO  Test that sending Tuple ->  Tuple  Test that sending a (JSON) String -> String  Test that sending raw bytes ->  raw bytes  
R481. Register the module under test  and have access to a source channel that drives messages into the processor and a output channel where output messages are sent.    Examples  Built-in Message conversion: send JSON to a processor module that accepts Tuples.  
R482. Register the module under test Send a message to the sink using a test source and verify the sink contents - this requires checking an external resource - depends on the sink 
R483. Create a directory structure that best benefits UI development.      The copying of the UI files and other gradle build tasks so that the UI can be run inside the embedded servlet container of XD will be a seperate story
R484. The UI code will be sitting in one or more top level directories in the repository    This story will address the need to     1) copy over the UI code into a location so that it can be picked up by the embedded servlet container when running inside eclipse
R485. The UI code will be sitting in one or more top level directories in the repository    This story will address the need to     1) copy over the UI code into a location so that it can be picked up by the embedded servlet container when the distribution zip is 'unzipped'.      After running ./xd-admin or ./xd-singlenode one should be able to hit the UI at http://localhost:8999/xd    (just an example)
R486. Configure embedded servlet container needs to know where to load the UI code.
R487. Enhance bean naming strategy or provide a value for the property that binds to this
R488. {code}  filter --expression="payload.myfield.startsWith('foo')"  {code}    Example using index:    {code}  filter --expression="payload.2.startsWith('foo')"  {code}    This should support nested keys as well:    {code}  filter --expression="payload.myfield.subfield.startsWith('foo')"  {code}    This is related to https://jira.springsource.org/browse/XD-676 and that in turn depends on SI being able to configure SpEL
R489. The JobLaunchRequest Transformer shall accept the following payloads:    * File  * JSON String  * Properties  * Map  * Tuple    Use/Migrate some of the logic from *JobParametersBean*, e.g. using the *DefaultJobParametersConverter*.    *Special Case File*    When handling a *File*, add special JobParameter *absoluteFilePath* populating it with *message.getPayload().getAbsolutePath()*    * Add unit tests      
R490. When creating a job, a named channel will be created with a name of job.<your job name>  i.e. job.foo. ======== Required components: - A Transform See XD-733 - JobPlugin needs to create the NamedChannel for the job and associate the transform.    > Registrar.xml will need an input channel?    > Name channel support will be required. - Add --channel to job rest apis to notify system that a named channel is requested.   *Unit Test  
R491. The HSQLDB that stores the JobRepository needs to have its content exposed via TCP (network service) so that container has access to update the status of a job run.   -Needs to have property that enumerates the host and port for the admin that is accessible by the user. -If one is not specified it should default to localhost:9500.  *Testing: - Unit Tests - Bring up module and admin.       ^Verify that default host and port work     ^Verify that container on different machine has access to admin   
R492. This story utilizes BatchAdmin and its restful interfaces to show the state of jobs in Spring XD.      *Steps    - Create a Branch in the BatchAdmin (we don't want to lose history)    - Update the restful API's to XD standards.    - Create bamboo task to push jars to artifactory    - Update gradle.build to pull in the Batchadmin jars.    - Expose the restful calls.
R493. Trigger can send a message to a named channel.  For example: trigger create --name mytrigger --definition "trigger --cron='*/10 * * * * *' --message='Good Luck, we are all counting on you'"  --channel foo   Where the --message contains the message that will be sent to foo job/component.
R494. Rename XDContainer, ContainerMain, *ContainerLauncher, ContainerLauncherFactory and any variable or methodNames, bean names, etc. that refer to container in favor of the term 'Node'. Eliminate the dirt.container package, and move Node into .server
R495. Remove System.setProperty() or System.getProperty() for internal xd properties. Use spring Environment abstraction instead. Also, replace "." in property names with '_' (XDPropertyKeys). This is compatible with environment variable names.     As a result, XD should accept System properties or environment variables or command line options. Command line options should have highest precedence. Retain StandardEnvironment order wrt to System properties and environment variable. 
R496. Currently *Main class provide alternate static methods for parsing CLI options. One used for testing does not call System.exit() just throws an exception. This code should be moved to spring-xd-test to support integration testing.
R497. The above config contains beans that must be in a common parent context for the AdminServer and Modules. Hence not really global since the (Node) doesn't need them itself. So the name is a bit misleading. Come up with something better.
R498. Spring Batch Admin provides a complete, but outdated implementation style, which covers the full administrative lifecycle of batch jobs, their creation, stop/start, and retrieving information about previous job executions and the status of currently executing job executions.  SpringXD has a different way of deploying, starting, and stopping jobs - by sending messages to containers that run the batch job.  However, the reporting state of a job is still stored in a common job repository.  The purpose of this story is to take the first step to merging in the existing code base that focuses only on the retrieval of information from Spring Batch Admin’s Job controller.  The current ‘REST API’ style of these commands should stay as close to the original spring batch admin style as possible.  There are several reasons for this 1. It works, and time to springone is short, and we mgmt has expectations around deliverables that we must strive to meet. 2. It gives Andrew a working contract to start developing a UI 3. We can take on this technical debt, but refactor after RC1 and before GA while and deliver end-user functionality.    Attached is the list of endpoints in spring batch admin 
R499. Unlike in spring-batch-admin, in SpringXD all the jobs the /modules/jobs directory is not ‘visible’ to query when the server starts.  Jobs only become visible to XD’s ‘jobs list’ command once they have been ‘created’.      Creating a Job in XD is an opportunity to specify additional values to any property placeholders in the job bean definition.  This isn’t part of spring-batch-admin.    We will not worry about the creation of job definition in this story.  Assume that they have been created already and that the GET for /jobs works as it does now for Spring XD.     We should however, make sure that there is always a replacement of the job name in the job bean definition to match the ‘--name’ specified in the command line.  That is “job create --name myjob --description “thisfunkyjob�?    will use ‘myjob to replace <job id="${xd.stream.name}" in the file thisfunkyjob.xml    *Implementation Suggestions*    This should hopefully just be a matter of changing job definition files to follow the naming pattern.    <job id="${xd.stream.name}" … />    *How to verify it works*    1. Create a JUnit integration style test that has ‘job create --name myjob --defintion “testJob�?’ and then deploy the job.  The name ‘myjob’ should appear in the job execution table  
R500. We should depend on  		<dependency> 			<groupId>org.springframework.batch</groupId> 			<artifactId>spring-batch-admin-manager</artifactId> 			<version>${project.parent.version}</version> 		</dependency> 		<dependency> 			<groupId>org.springframework.batch</groupId> 			<artifactId>spring-batch-admin-resources</artifactId> 			<version>${project.parent.version}</version> 		</dependency>  we are using spring batch 2.2.0.RELEASE.   We need to depend on spring-batch-admin version 1.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT   
R501. The current XD JobController that returns a list of jobs has quite a different API signature than what is in spring-batch-admin.  To simplify the UI development, a new controller JobAdminController, will be created that lives under the request path /jobs/admin.  The goal is to return a the current JSON structure of spring-batch-admin /jobs/ request and make only minimal changes to implementations of controllers as found .  See #1 in the Doc (link to json output doc for spring batch).    *Implementation Suggestions*    There will need to be some SpringMVC setup that will enable the current style of spring-batch-admin controller requests to co-exist with the existing XD Controllers, e.g. the use of .json for json marshalling etc.  This may in fact be the bulk of time spend in this first story to integration spring-batch-admin style controllers into XD.    A new controller named JobAdminController that in the spring-xd-dirt project in the package org.springframework.xd.dirt.rest.  The JobAdminController will not need to follow the same HATEOAS style as the other controllers at this time.    The current controller in Spring Batch Admin looks like this  {code}      @RequestMapping(value = "/jobs", method = RequestMethod.GET)      public void jobs(ModelMap model, @RequestParam(defaultValue = "0") int startJob,              @RequestParam(defaultValue = "20") int pageSize) {          int total = jobService.countJobs();          TableUtils.addPagination(model, total, startJob, pageSize, "Job");          Collection<String> names = jobService.listJobs(startJob, pageSize);          List<JobInfo> jobs = new ArrayList<JobInfo>();          for (String name : names) {              int count = 0;              try {                  count = jobService.countJobExecutionsForJob(name);              }              catch (NoSuchJobException e) {                  // shouldn't happen              }              boolean launchable = jobService.isLaunchable(name);              boolean incrementable = jobService.isIncrementable(name);              jobs.add(new JobInfo(name, count, null, launchable, incrementable));          }          model.addAttribute("jobs", jobs);      }  {code}    Something like  {code}  @RequestMapping(value = "/jobs/admin/jobs", method = RequestMethod.GET)   public void jobs(ModelMap model, @RequestParam(defaultValue = "0") int startJob,              @RequestParam(defaultValue = "20") int pageSize) {           // We do *not* have to query the Spring Batch Admin “JobService�? at this time, but        //  instead use the  JobDeployer to get information about jobs launched by Spring XD          Iterable<JobDefinition> jobDefinitions =  dobDeployer.findAll()         // copy these over to a List<JobInfo> as best as possible, copy name over.         // not sure how ‘description’ is getting added to the JSON        // pari      }  {code}  *How to verify it works*  A sample job needs to be in the modules/job directory. JobCommandTests/AbstractJobIntegrationTest seems to have what is need to stage a job for   
R502. 1. How XD Yarn application should be packaged and bootstrapped? 2. Where the code should be? Within xd itself or separate repo?
R503. 1. How we talk to the XD instance(s) on Yarn 2. There is a rest interface which location can be exposed either via resource manager or appmaster 3. Technically appmaster could also expose interface which could eihter be proxy for xd rest or dedicated interface implementation(i.e. thrift or spring int)
R504. We need to be able to talk to appmaster which will control the whole xd yarn app.  1. Choose the implementation? Thrift? Spring Int? Something else? 
R505. 1. We'll need a system which give better control of what yarn/xd containers are out there and what is a status of those containers. 2. We also need grouping of containers order to choose, prioritize and scale tasks. 3. We need heartbeating of the grid nodes. Hadoop Yarn itself doesn't give enough tools to know if container is "alive".
R506. Technically speaking of we want to integrate XD UI on Hadoop tools we should do it so that the proxy on resource manager works with XD UI. From Hadoop Yarn resource manager point of view this proxied url is the applications tracking url(which is registered when application is deployed).
R507. Currently the Job launcher launches all the batch jobs configured in the job module.    Please refer, ModuleJobLauncher's executeBatchJob().    This makes the JobRegistry registers with multiple batch jobs under the same Spring XD job name (group name).    Also, it is understood that having multiple jobs configuration under the same config xml is uncommon.
R508. We need to have a properties section (documented as well) so that users can setup their jdbc connections for the various components.
R509. {{container}} and {{event}}. {{XDContainer}} references and is referenced by {{ContainerStartedEvent}} (and stopped).    https://sonar.springsource.org/drilldown/measures/7173?metric=package_cycles&rids%5B%5D=7717    
R510. Use a profile or similar to only include the {{Environment}} conditionally (currently in module-common.xml.  Also  Jon Brisbin one thing to keep in mind: we talked about having a properties file for XD that configured the RingBuffer et al in a non-default way  Jon Brisbin e.g. no event loop Dispatchers…a ThreadPoolDispatcher with a large thread pool size (50 threads? 100?)…and maybe even two RingBufferDispatchers: input and output  Jon Brisbin so we might want to change from strictly a default Environment bean to an EnvironmentFactoryBean with a specific configuration…thinking about it now I maybe should add a namespace element for the Environment
R511. The splitter functionality in Spring Integration should be exposed to XD as a processing module.  The splitter should use a SpEL expression to specify how to split the message up.      *Implementation Suggestions*    This should be a simple XML based module definition that has input/output channels and has the SpEL expression parameterized.  The default value of the SpEL expression should result in the message not being split.    *How to check it works*    The current file or tail input source can be used to split up the text in a file into words.  The tail module should be checked to see how many lines of text it will read into memory at once.  The file module node with the file-to-string transformer will only work for small files as it keep the whole file in memory.      If there is a big memory inefficiency in using the tail file input source, create a new story to investigate how to have a file based input source that creates a message per line of text or something that is will not result in excessive memory usage.  
R512. Create a processing module based on SI's aggregator component.  The completion criteria for the aggregator should be a simple count of messages (e.g. received 50 messages) and a timeout so that messages don't stay in the aggregator module for more than 30 seconds.     *Implementation suggestions*    Create an XML based processing module definition using the SI aggregator namespace.  Only the options to support the features in the description should be exposed as property placeholders.    *How to know it works*  A shell style integration test that has a source that sends a known amount of messages.  A ticktock like module would perhaps be a good example.  10 messages sent every 100ms with an aggregator set to a 'aggregate count' of 10, should have 1 message output (perhaps to file sink whose name is based on time as well, is that possible.).  A ticktock example with a 1 second delay and with the aggregator module set to have a timeout of 0.5 seconds will have only one message in the file (again assumign the file name has a timestamp/counter in the filename). 
R513. UDP and Legacy syslog sources emit a {{Map}}; reactor emits a POJO. Make them consistent and emit {{Tuple}}s.
R514. The xd-singlenode script currently has '644' permissions unlike xd-admin and xd-container (which have '755'):     {code}  -rwxr-xr-x  1 mark  staff  5899 Aug 26 16:19 xd-admin  -rwxr-xr-x  1 mark  staff  5955 Aug 26 16:19 xd-container  -rw-r--r--  1 mark  staff  5919 Aug 26 16:19 xd-singlenode  {code}  
R515. https://sonar.springsource.org/drilldown/measures/7173?metric=package_cycles&rids%5B%5D=7717
R516. JavaDoc issues are causing the build to fail with Java 8
R517. This is issue depends on XD-761  https://build.springsource.org/browse/XD-JDK8
R518. Triggers will be a source and no longer as a unique module.  * The following have to be removed:  ** spring-xd-dirt:    -- package: org.springframework.xd.dirt.plugins.trigger  -- META-INF: spring-xd/plugins/triggers.xml  -- org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.TriggerPlugin    *The following beans will require updates to remove the trigger code  ** spring-xd-dirt:    --META-INF: spring-xd/internal/deployers.xml - Remove Triggerdeployer  --org.springframework.xd.dirt.plugins.job.JobPlugin - Remove the registrars for fixedDelay, fixedRate, Cron.  As well as the component selection, only need the job-modules-bean  --Update the tests to use the trigger as a source, instead of the trigger module.  ** spring-xd-shell:  Remove trigger commands and associated tests    ** xd controllers:  Remove trigger controllers and their associated tests   This list cover most but not all the components affected.  --Success criteria--  Successful unit and integration tests.    
R519. Currently we have 2 trigger sources: trigger & cron-trigger.  The preference is to have a user to just use a single trigger source.  for example: * trigger > :myjob * trigger --cron='...' >:myjob * trigger --fixedDelay='...' > :myjob  One option to handle this is to use spel to reference a bean and then have different trigger beans defined. i.e. trigger='cronTriggerBean'.  Each trigger bean would setup the channel with the correct poller.  
R520. Jobs will be started via trigger.  So we won't need the JobTriggerBean.
R521. Also drop the enhanced portion of the EnhancedStreamParser.
R522. User shall have the ability to get a listing of available named channels (order by name ascending) from the shell  * Add support to controllers * Add tests
R523. See discussion at https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/pull/250/files#r6034885
R524. When doing *xd:> http post* and press the *tab* key. One should get a list of available options. Right now nothing happens. I have to press *--* and then tab to get the options.  Interestingly, this works for *stream create* + *tab* key
R525. In order to hook up the to get access to all the jobs available the job registry has to be shared.  currently the only implmentation is is the MapJobRegistry.    ====  Testability.  ====  The admin will need to be see all jobs created by its containers.
R526. for an example, see comments here:  https://jira.springsource.org/browse/XD-671

R531. See https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/pull/240#discussion_r6045724
R532. It would be nice to be able to have modules that are simply made of:  - Their context xml file  - Some kind of manifest that expresses dependencies  and have the runtime take care of the deps
R533. See discussion at https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/pull/240#discussion_r6045724
R534. export XD_HOME=foo  gradle clean test     build fails. Need to detected environment variables and override for the build
R535. This came up when working on email source. There is <int-mail:imap-idle-channel-adapter> and <int-mail:inbound-channel-adapter>  It would be nice to be able to put those in two profiles and have one of the profile being activated from module options (e.g. email --polling=true|false)  Don't know the runtime cost of activating profiles, but we could blindly activate profiles from all options passed explicitly :  <beans profile="profile-[optionname]-[optionvalue]">  Not sure if this is the same as XD-132
R536. Should it be fatal vs. warning?
R537. related to XD-779.   * We need the ability to provide JSON serializable JobExecution information. * Change from using JavaSerialization back to returning objects 
R538. similar to ChannelRegistry:    - AbstractChannelRegistryTests that has the real tests  - subclasses for each impl provide the registry to be tested    Thus one test can run against multiple transports.
R539. SingleNodeMain.launchSingleNodeServer(options) calls System.exit() causing a gradle buffer underflow. This is called from SingleNodeMainIntegrationTests. System.exit() should be called from the main method instead. 
R540. Once XD-785 is merged
R541. Commands like "stream deploy" have changed over time to allow passing a "--all" option.    So it's either {{stream deploy foo}} or {{stream deploy --all}}. This has a number of drawbacks, given that these are the only 2 alternatives:  - Implementation code is cumbersome  - None of the options can be marked mandatory, yet one of them is required. This has to be checked in the command code itself  - TAB completion is less powerful as the shell doesn't know if we want the first or the second form.      Consider splitting those commands into two distinct commands, one as before and one literally named {{stream deploy all}}.
R542. https://sonar.springsource.org/drilldown/measures/7173?metric=package_tangle_index&rids%5B%5D=7717
R543. The current rabbitmq sink uses the attribute routing-key, which defaults to the name of the stream.  This should be change to use the attribute routing-key-expression so that the routing-key can be determined using SpEL.  This will enable a dynamic evaluation of the routing-key based on message payload/header.    *Implementation Suggestions*    This hopefully should be changing the XML description of the sink to 		    routing-key-expression="${routingKey:'${xd.stream.name}'}    This way, the ${xd.stream.name} is surrounded by a single quote to indicate a string literal to SpEL in the default case.      *How to verify it works.*    One of the simple uses of this is to create a routing key based on payload.  In a distributed word-count example, the hashcode of a word would be sent to a certain number of processing modules that would perform the count. The idea is that the same word is sent to the same node over and over again, in particular if in-memory counters or state is computed - using centralized redis counters this wouldn't be necessary in the case of only counter state.    The stream     http | rabbit --routingKey="'word-' + payload.hashCode() % 3"    is an example of a stream that can be used to verify that messages published to a direct exchange will have routing keys of the value word-0, word-1, and word-2.  Binding a queue to each of these routing keys, one can observe the contents of messages in the queue to make sure that words are being routed to the appropriate queue, e.g. publishing "hello" as the payload of an http request should always appear in the same queue.  The rabbitmq admin console can be used for this purpose.  
R544. Job channels need to have a namespace.    i.e. job-somejobname.  Where the - is the delimiter for the namespace.    The preference is to use the : instead of the -.  But XD-766 needs to be completed in order to support this.
R545. Based on the PR discussion: https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-xd/pull/270#commitcomment-4003291  We need to consider turning on multiline mode for pattern matching.
R546. This is to set the appropriate data source, so that the container will use admins batch repository.
R547. We need an abstraction in place to retrieve messages from a "named channel" programmatically.    Right now there is no implementation agnostic way of doing this (such as receiveMessage(), queueSize()).    This could be quite useful for integration tests of streams. E.g. to do more focussed tests without resorting to "temp-files" and non-essential sinks or sources etc. - e.g.     {code}  :routeit > router --expression=payload.contains('a')?':foo':':bar'  {code}
R548. For testing purposes it would be super-helpful if there be a hook to get notified when a named channel is up and running. In current tests one may have to resort to "Thread.sleep".
R549. Currently it's possible to do something like   {code}    http --prot=8888  {code}    It is possible to validate property names by parsing the module definition file(s) directly and matching property placeholders (or profile declarations that may be mapped to properties, etc). This must account recursively for imports as well. (I have some code in a branch that does this).   
R550. The parameters are not optimal for the counter name between "Aggregate Counter" "Field Value Counter"  --counterName versus --name
R551. This might mean we should adjust our hadoopDistro options to the ones supported in the new release - hadoop12 (default), cdh4, hdp13, phd1 and hadoop21
R552. We should provide a better shell integration when XD is run on Yarn.  1. yarn kill --id TAB completion 2. yarn submit, more options like app name 3. yarn list, filter by app states, etc 4. admin config server TAB completion for running xd apps on yarn
R553. The following sequence results in "Dispatcher has no subscribers" error  (stack trace below), because deleting stream2 disconnects stream1 from the foo channel. Current work on XD-685 has infrastructure for disconnecting just the channels involved in a stream, so should make it easier to fix this issue once merged.     stream create stream1 --definition "time > :foo"  stream create stream2 --definition "http > :foo"  stream create stream3 --definition ":foo > file"  stream destroy stream2  // expect file sink to still get time, but instead blows up b/c  // deleteOutbound("foo") killed links b/w foo and both local output channels    Server stack trace:  10:47:11,921 ERROR task-scheduler-6 handler.LoggingHandler:140 -

R554. We need a REST endpoint to launch a job.    Given the constraint on JobRegistry being not persistent and not available outside the container JVM, we can not use the batch job admin controller/service to launch the job.    One possible way is to use the trigger source to launch the job at XD.
R555. As of XD-685, we no longer have the ability to:  1) Tap a named channel, ala stream1=:foo > sink stream2= :tap:foo > sink  2) Tap a stream whose source is a named channel ala stream2=:tap:stream1 > sink  3) Tap a label ala stream1=http | obfuscator: transform --expression=payload.replaceAll('password','*') | file stream2=:tap:stream1.obfuscator > sink    Loss of named channel support is due to the fact that we are creating a WireTap on a module's local output channel only (thus we never tap named channels). We are not supporting labels because we only create a named channel called "tap:stream.module" on stream creation, so later creation of tap on stream1.obfuscator is referring to a non-existent named channel.
R556. When an XD job is destroyed/deleted, the batch jobRepository entries for the job (associated JobInstances, JobExecutions etc.,) and the BatchJobLocator entries.
R557. Now that the new batch admin api is taking shape, we need to rebase the XD web UI to use this.  It's more than just changing the http urls sent to the xd server since the new API is not identical to the old one.
R558. Once spring-batch-admin 1.3.0.M1 is available, update the build to use it.  Likely to be Sept 7 or 9
R559. Some recent changes caused this to be turned off. Basically the change was to police whether a stream is well formed at create time, rather than deploy time.  By deferring that check we can create composed streams that are not deployable by themselves but that are when used as building blocks in proper streams.
R560. A user should be able to view some important details of the last execution of a job from a job list.  The {{/batch/jobs}} REST endpoint should provide extra fields not currently available in the {{JobInfo}} class.  At a minimum, I would like to see:  * startTime * startDate * last job parameters * duration * last job status
R561. The admin UI should be polling the server to automatically pick up any new jobs, executions, and instances.
R562. Would be nice to have a ServiceActivator Processor available so that if one had an existing Spring bean they could simply describe the bean id and method name - without going through the full complexity of creating a processing module.
R563. Currently, the url for accessing the XD UI is {{http://localhost:8080/admin-ui/index.html}}.  This feels messy and dated.  We should be able to access the ui without explicitly including the index.html, like this:  {code} http://localhost:8080/admin-ui {code}  
R564. When converting a JSON string to a tuple the JSON may contain id. This method should handle this. Same with timestamp
R565. If true(default): filter for delete messages in the twitter stream and route to a discard channel. This creates a twitter stream including only new tweets and no references to deleted ones.
R566. My current thinking is...       ChannelRegistry -> MessageBus     RabbitChannelRegistry -> RabbitMessageBus     ...    Then, method names change like so:       createInbound -> registerConsumer     createOutbound -> registerProducer      
R567. <int:channel id="input"/> <int:object-to-json-transformer input-channel="input" output-channel="output"/> <int:channel id="output"/>

Invalid login/password at com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPStore.protocolConnect(IMAPStore.java:663) 
R569. Twitter search source should produce JSON or Pojo. The Pojo requires a custom wrapper class that is JSON friendly (e.g., zero arg constructor). The twittersearch module should have a parameter --json true/false (default true) to control the output type.
R570. org.springframework.integration.x.bus.Bridge should now be called Binding    we can also move the INBOUND/OUTBOUND direction (or possibly the CONSUMER/PRODUCER role) into this class; that should simplify its usage in conditional code within the MessageBus code and also reduce the use of "in" and "out" as Strings in that same code
R571. We also would like to upgrade the hsqldb version on spring batch admin so that both are compatible.
R572. Currently, the way that we are accessing JobExecutions from batch admin, the JobParameters are not being filled in.  We are using a {{org.springframework.batch.admin.service.JdbcSearchableJobExecutionDao}} to grab the job executions from the database. The database queries that it uses does not include the JobParameters (which is stored in a different table).  I think that this will require a change to batch admin in order to properly expose the parameters.
R573. Now that taps are just channels, we need to update the docs.    The preceding colon is no longer needed (and will be removed altogether), so all examples should be like this:    {code}  tap:foo > bar  {code}    
R574. Currently this works: stream create foo --definition "tap:baz.time > log" stream create baz --definition "time | file"  But this doesn't: stream create foo --definition "tap:baz > log" stream create baz --definition "time | file"  This is because the parser translates references to "tap:baz" to named channel "tap:baz.time" (the name of the stream's first module). If the stream is not yet created, the parser cannot perform this translation. A fix for this will likely be related to the fix needed for XD-812.
R575. There are couple of issues here:  1) The admin server destroy() - close event's onApplicationEvent(ContextClosedEvent) listener has stop() to stop the admin server's tomcat instance. The stop() also calls the applicationContext's destroy() which loops again to stop.  2) With HSQLServer or any batch db server(in future), the admin server stop() also needs to handle the batch db server shutdown.

R577. In the XD UI, the list of jobs is refreshed from the server every 5 seconds.  There are also tooltips that are activated when hovering over a job execution. These tooltips are no longer responsive (ie- they remain on the page and don't disappear) after the list of jobs is refreshed.

R579. Like just discussed after the Spring One session, it would be nice to have a packaging model for custom modules. Instead of putting all libs in one directory and an XML in another, it could be a fat jar including some metadata file pointing to either an XML or to a JavaConfig configuration class inside the jar. Some more words why I think it's important to have something like that: Spring XD can be very well used in the enterprise, and at least for job modules it's likely to have some dependencies. So what do you have to do now to deploy such a module? Build a jar with your build process, then get it from your repository, unpack it and somehow find the relevant XML to copy it into the appropriate folder, then inspect the POM to find out what all the dependencies are, direct and transient, and get them from your repository to copy them into the appropriate folder. And of course, copy the jar. And when using Spring XD in distributed mode, you have to do it several times. With the approach mentioned above you just build your fat jar with your build process and distribute it to all your nodes, nothing complicated.  And if you implement it like that it's easy to have a JavaConfig support that's almost the same.
R580. Add back "classifier = 'dist'" to distZip build target - it was was accidentally removed.
R581. First take on this involves - being able to deploy the two separate applications: xd-admin & xd-container - being able to CF-service provided redis & rabbit for internal needs of XD - to some extent, make modules smart and CF aware (e.g. http source uses correct port)
R582. As part of running in Cloud Foundry, one quick workaround for the lack of "classpath" support would be to use the Spring Boot Loader special ClassLoader and jar-inside-a-jar support: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-loader
R583. When using jobs, taps we no longer need to have the leading :.  i.e. :tap:foo.  We should only support tap:foo.
R584. Tap '@' and using numbers instead of module names.
R585. We should adjust our --hadoopDistro options to the ones supported in the new spring-data-hadoop 1.0.1.RELEASE - hadoop12 (default), cdh4, hdp13, phd1, hadoop20  This includes updating the wiki pages
R586. The README.md at:    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/README.md  ...says:  "Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the contributor's agreement"  Navigating to the <contributor's agreement> link takes the user to the ICLA web page at:  https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup  //exp: The Project field's dropdown should have an option for "Spring XD" //act: There's no "Spring XD" option
R587. The gemfire modules currently accept server host and port. Provide an option to specify a locator host and port
R588. Looks like there are some version mismatch issues with the build/packaging of the XD components. Looking in xd/lib I see the following which looks suspicious:  mqtt-client-0.2.1.jar mqtt-client-1.0.jar  jackson-core-asl-1.9.13.jar jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.12.jar  spring-integration-core-3.0.0.M3.jar spring-integration-http-2.2.5.RELEASE.jar  spring-data-commons-1.6.0.M1.jar spring-data-commons-core-1.4.0.RELEASE.jar 
R589. The syntax for both taps and job channels will be prefixed with the word tap. * The parser will search both the all (stream and job for now) registries to find the "name".   * If the name is present in only in one registry then that definition will be used.   * If the name is  present both registries a syntax exception will be issued.    - The user then can optionally specify which registry to use by adding a second token to the definition that specifies the type of channel the user wants. 	- i.e. 	tap:{stream}:streamName > mySink * If the user attempts to place a job on the greater (left hand) side without specifying a notification a syntax error will be thrown. Format:  -- tap:[type]:name > $ -- $ > tap:[type]:name   -- Example:    tap:streamName >mySink    tap:stream:streamName > mySink    mySource|myProcessor > tap:stream:mySink    myEmailSource > tap:job:jobName.step1    myEmailSource > tap:jobName.step1    tap:job:jobName-notifications > myEmailSink
R590. Wildcard support for associating inbound and outbound channels with modules.   The wild card will be represented by an asterisk '*'. Example:  myEmailSource > tap:job:*	send message to all jobs myEmailSource > tap:*		send message to all stream/job taps myEmailSource > :*foo*		send message to all channels that contain the channels that contains the word 'foo' tap:*bar > myEmailSource  
R591. Add serialVersionUID to the objects in package org.springframework.integration.x.twitter:  * XDEntities * XDUrlEntity * XDHashTagEntity * XDMentionEntity * XDMediaEntity * XDTickerSymbolEntity * XDTweet  The absence creates warnings during compile time.
R592. The doc at http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M3/reference/html/#_modules_and_spring refers to an old version of the counter sink, when it was still hardwired to use redis.  The text next to it that explains placeholders is out of date (with respect to the redis placeholders)
R593. Similar to what has been done for e.g. FileSink, refactor metrics related sinks to use smart Thread.sleep() timings
R594. Apart from sanity checks, there is not much that ties FileModuleRegistry to actual java.io.Files. Using the Resource abstraction would work just the same, and would allow loading modules from the classpath in constrained environments or other file systems/locations. (HDFS /HTTP)
R595. From the CLI, one should be able to get a listing of modules and be able to specifically ask for jobs, sources, sinks, and processors.  A brief description of them would also be nice - this might come from adding some metadata into the definition.    Finer grained description/implementation suggestion TBD
R596. This story will need to be broken down further.    The current code mixes together the type conversion that happens within a single JVM (for data that is passed on a local transport between modules) and serialization/deserialization between JVMs.  This should be separated.    There was a suggestion that we could perhaps use typed data channels in SI as a means implement the type conversion between modules.  The media-type conversion support in Spring 4 is another part of this solution.
R597. Similar to xpath with XML, there are now some initial support in SI that enable the use of filter/routers based on JSON Path expressions.  That support needs to be reviewed and then brought up to the level of exposure in Spring XD so that router/filter modules could use JSON Path.  json-path-filter/router are components that need to be created, perhaps others.    This story needs to be broken down further.
R598. Needs some investigation on how the update information from Spring Batch listeners can be sent as a message across modules in a single node configuration as well as across JVMs in a distributed node configuration.
R599. We need to move the BatchJobExecutionsByJobName method to BatchJobsController as that seems appropriate
R600. The admin-ui currently has no unit tests.  Need to add a test suite and hook it up to the build so that tests are run on every build.
R601. Get rid of all the thread.sleeps and code that supported them.
R602. Parser creates a module compose command that allows a user to create a module of other modules.  This composed module can accept parameters.
R603. We need to verify that we are seeing improved throughput when using the reactor based syslog adapter.      A suggestion on a basic stream to perform a microbenchmark this would be using in-memory counters, singlenode with the stream definition "syslog | counter".    Based on the results of this microbenchmark, other stories may need to be created.
R604. i.e.  http | group1: filter | group1: transform | file   then specifying anything labelled group1 goes to machineX
R605. Commands that pair up with the functionality described in XD-859    module list  (would list all modules in a table format)  module list --type=source  (would list only source modules)    and so on.
R606. 2 issues exist:    1)     Current this does not create an error in the shell    {code}  stream create --name s1 --definition "http | log"  stream create --name s2 --definition "http | log"  {code}    On the server-side I see:    {code}  Caused by: java.net.BindException: Address already in use    sun.nio.ch.Net.bind0(Native Method)    sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:344)    sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:336)    sun.nio.ch.ServerSocketChannelImpl.bind(ServerSocketChannelImpl.java:199)    sun.nio.ch.ServerSocketAdaptor.bind(ServerSocketAdaptor.java:74)    org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioServerBoss$RegisterTask.run(NioServerBoss.java:193)    org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.AbstractNioSelector.processTaskQueue(AbstractNioSelector.java:366)    org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.AbstractNioSelector.run(AbstractNioSelector.java:290)    org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioServerBoss.run(NioServerBoss.java:42)  	... 3 more  {code}    2)  The Stream should not be saved to the StreamDefinitionRepo in case of an error.    
R607. Just wanted to create story for this - so we can consider whether this should be addressed.  In at least 2 modules we use non-persisted states. We may want to consider making them persistent:   *Twitter Search* uses an in-memory *MetadataStore* that keeps track of the twitter ids. There exists a corresponding issue for Spring Integration:  "Create a Redis-backed MetadataStore" See: https://jira.springsource.org/browse/INT-3085  *File Soure*'s File Inbound Channel Adapter uses a AcceptOnceFileListFilter, which uses an in-memory Queue to keep track of duplicate files.  
R608. This story may need to be broken into several stories  Particularly for Batch scenarios one may not want to run a "file-to-string-transformer" on the payload file in the file source but rather handle/pass the file reference itself (local SAN etc.) - e.g. in case somebody drops a 2GB or in scenarios where one wants to push those large files into HDFS and run hadoop jobs on the data.  This is important for Batch Jobs as they need to access the file itself for the reader.   We need to *keep in mind the various transports we support*. Not sure how Kryo handles file serialization. I would think we only need the File Meta Data to be persisted not the file-data itself (make that configurable??). 
R609. It looks like we don't handle deletion of source files currently. We should provide some support for that - Maybe there is a way to into Spring Integration's PseudoTransactionManager support:    http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/transaction/PseudoTransactionManager.html    The *File Source* should possibly also support File archival functionality (But that might also be a dedicated processor?). Not sure where we want to set the semantic boundaries for the File Source.  
R610. The admin Server's tomcat is not shutdown properly. There is an existing method shutdownCleanly() on AdminServer but the spring-xd-shell tests hang when we use this method to shutdown the admin server.   
R611. Spring batch workflows are great for complex hadoop operations but if I want to create a simple processor that executes some hadoop fs in groovy, it would be nice to do this:  {code} <service-activator output-channel="output" input-channel="input">    <hadoop:script id="loadScript" language="groovy"> 	 def outputPath = "${hdfsPath}"	 	 fsh.put("-", outputPath)      </hadoop:script> </service-activator> {code}  The goal of this hadoop script is to use in a stream like this:"file | script" that puts a file byte for byte to hdfs. An enhanced hdfs sink that's optimized for binary data like images/pdfs might be more elegant but I was hoping that this would work. This script gets ignored by Spring XD. But even if it didn't, I am not sure the "-" stdin put would work as hoped. 
R612. When JMX is enabled, the Module's output channel processed by StreamPlugin is a Proxy. Thus it fails the "instanceof" test used to apply the WireTap to the output channel. 
R613. The SI JMX MBeanExporter proxies the output channel created in a module context when JMX is enabled. We have to unwrap the proxy in StreamPlugin in order to add the tap. XD-877 temporarily introduced this code, but a more elegant solution is called for. Perhaps this will involve SI making addInterceptor an interface method.
R614. Currently, the "data" directory created by the HSQLDB process during the tests run is not cleaned up and may cause issues. We should delete the "data" directory after each test completion.
R615. We should consider moving to wire.js to encourage dependency injection in the UI Javascript code.  See here: https://github.com/cujojs/wire/blob/master/docs/get.md
R616. Set the enableJmx to false because contexts are not getting destroyed properly, and in some cases prevents testSystemPropertiesOverridesDefault from running successfully.
R617. In our tests the context is destroyed at the end of each module.  It should be destroyed at the close of the container.
R618. If the spring batch database has already been initialized do not re-initialize for each test run.    
R619. Add Batch Job Listeners Automatically    * Each major listener category should send notifications to own channel (StepExecution, Chunk, Item etc.)  * Add attribute to disallow automatic adding of listeners
R620. Currently, a lot of jars that are on the classpath of xd-dirt are there to support modules.  We should move those to the lib/ construct of a module and remove them from the CP of dirt.    But this should not be done by simple "mv", as we'd lose version tracking and dependency management offered by gradle.    Pending a "dependency-aware" ModuleRegistry, we should be able to alter the build.gradle file so that it  - knows about individual modules (maybe handles them as project)  - copies its libs into the appropriate directory  - does not copy dependencies that are already legitimate dependencies of xd-dirt (this can be achieved by runtime introspection of the dependeny tree of both projects)    
R621. This conflicts with and 'out of the box' hadoop installation that uses 8080 as the 'map reduce shuffle port'.    8088 sound ok?    
R622. We probably need to look into some options to run our JavaScript tests (Jasmine) as part of the build process - some possibilities:    * Jasmine Gradle Plugin https://github.com/dzhaughnroth/jasmine-gradle-plugin  * Saga - http://timurstrekalov.github.io/saga/    Looks like Maven has slightly better support: http://searls.github.io/jasmine-maven-plugin/index.html    See also: XD-865
R623. For testing, it would be useful to access the deployed Module instances to connect sources and or sinks to a module's input and output channels, etc. This could be a simple as exposing the deployedModuleMap on ModuleDeployer or possibly something more elaborate if this level of granularity is generally useful for runtime administration.
R624. In M3, the batch job behavior has changed. In M2, it was much easier to create an invoke a batch job. In M3, a trigger is required. Figuring that change out isn't a big deal but the behavior of this batch job in M3 throws a stack trace, yet it executes.   In M2, this same batch job runs fine with no stack trace.   Logs are attached. I can't see a difference in the container log property files from M2 to M3. Turning the log settings down will suppress the traces, but I was not expecting the traces since they did not show up in M2.  Stream Definitions:  job create --name pdfLoadBatchJob --definition "batch-pdfload --inputPath='LOCAL_PDF_PATH' --hdfsPath='REMOTE_HDFS_PATH'"   stream create --name pdfloadtrigger --definition "trigger > job:pdfLoadBatchJob"
R625. When clicking on a specific job execution from the job executions bar chart, the tool tips display isn't aligned with the job parameters. Please see the attachment.
R626. Currently, for adhoc launching of Batch jobs you have to use:  {code} stream create --name myTriggerStream --definition "trigger > job:helloSpringXD" {code}  For renewed triggering of the job you have to undeploy and then redeploy the job. It would be nice if there was possibly a slightly simpler way of doing this.  Just FYI - As a different approach you can also use the HTTP source:  {source} job create --name myjob --definition "myjob" stream create --name myjobhttp --definition "http > job:http" http post --data "{}" {source}  
R627. The ability to configure message conversion via parameters. Consider programatic configuration of data type channels. Values can be media type, e.g., application/json or a java class name.
R628. We should support *java.io.file* payloads in order to support non-textual file and large text file payloads being uploaded to HDFS.   Currently text file payloads are converted to a text stream in memory and, non-String payloads are converted to JSON first, using an "object-to-json-transformer".   Ultimately we need to support streams such as "file | hdfs" where the actually payload being copied to HDFS is not necessarily JSON or textual.  Need to be able to support headers in the message that will indicate which HDFS file the data should be stored in.  
R629. currently xd-container will not start due to a DB connection failure if the xd-admin is not already running    In fact, if someone is not using Batch jobs at all with XD, they should not even need a DB connection for either xd-admin or xd-container to run    so... consider using LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy so a connection failure would only occur when the DataSource is actually invoked to retrieve a connection
R630. When INT-3133 is resolved, SpEL {{PropertyAccessor}} s are inherited from parent contexts.    Instead of adding the {{JsonPropertyAccessor}} to each module's context, add it to the parent instead.
R631. We currently include jetty-util-6.1.26.jar but we need to add correct jar for different distributions - PHD uses jetty-util-7.6.10.v20130312.jar    Need to check hadoop-hdfs dependencies for the distros and add jetty-util-* to the jar copy for each distro  
R632. Tests that leverage [Redis|Rabbit]AvailableRule often create another connection factory in the test body but fail to close it.  Tests should properly close the resource. As an added benefit, the rule itself can expose the resource that it created for deciding whether to skip the test or not
R633. The xd-dirt project should be split in at least 3 parts:  - Classes and resources pertaining to the admin-server  - Container server  - Shared classes  Additionally, we may consider splitting the first two in half as well, having a separate project for CLI handling (and hence introduce 2 other projects for YARN, etc) 
R634. kparikh-mbpro:spring-xd kparikh$ grep -r 6379 * | grep java spring-xd-analytics/src/test/java/org/springframework/xd/analytics/metrics/common/RedisRepositoriesConfig.java:			cf.setPort(6379); spring-xd-analytics/src/test/java/org/springframework/xd/analytics/metrics/integration/GaugeHandlerTests.java:			cf.setPort(6379); spring-xd-analytics/src/test/java/org/springframework/xd/analytics/metrics/integration/RichGaugeHandlerTests.java:			cf.setPort(6379); spring-xd-dirt/src/test/java/org/springframework/xd/dirt/listener/RedisContainerEventListenerTest.java:			cf.setPort(6379); 
R635.   It looks like Container's ContainerStartedEvent and ContainerStoppedEvent are published from ContainerLauncher's context whereas the ContainerEventListeners are running in XDContainer's context. This makes the container start/stop events not getting processed.  
R636. It should be possible to supply a start or end date (or none for the present), plus a "count" value for the number of points required (i.e. after or prior to the given time).
R637. Offers the functionality to make http request to a web service. i.e. outbound http gateway.  Example implementations:  stream create --name foo --definition "trigger |rest --reply-timeout=1 --url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/geojson/all/day|log"    stream create --name foos --definition "trigger --payload=lat=34.0567006&lon=-84.34368810000001&site=all&smap=1&searchresult=Roswell%2C%20GA%2030076%2C%20USA#.UktzaWSG1Dd | rest --url=http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php? |log"    
R638. Should keep the critical error count as close to zero as possible.
R639. Users need to register custom message converters used by modules.
R640. The XD build breaks with Gradle 1.8 due to some changes in dependency resolution.
R641. See issue https://jira.springsource.org/browse/XD-862    The docs should be updated to include examples that show how to use the standard 'SpEL' based splitter, transformer, filters with #jsonPath expressions.
R642. Once XD-887 is merged, gradually convert more modules.    Recipe:  1) Move the <module>.xml file to <module>/config/<module>.xml  2) Declare a :module.<type>.<module> gradle project  3) Move dependencies from dirt project to newly created module project  4) gradle build picks it up.    gradle clean build + manual test  Also have a look at gradle cleanEclipse eclipse
R643. File source should output either the File itself (serialized File object) or the contents as a byte[]. This option is configured by a parameter --contents=true.  The byte[] may be converted to a String using XD Message Conversion, e.g., --output = text/plain;charset=UTF-8
R644. Enhance the stream parser to take message conversion into account in order to validate or automatically configure converters. For example:   {noformat:nopanel=true} source   --outputType=my.Foo  | sink --inputType=some.other.Bar   is likely invalid since XD doesn't know how to convert Foo->Bar.  {noformat}
R645. See also XD-903, XD-915  A lot of dependencies have been added with the "compile" scope as an oversight over time. Some of them are only required at runtime, some may not be required anymore.
R646. json parameter is no longer required. Use --outputType=application/json instead
R647. Was attempting to test mqtt, turns out I don't have the proper rabbitmq thing installed. So far so good, I get these kinds of exceptions:  {noformat}  Unable to connect to server (32103) - java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused    org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.internal.TCPNetworkModule.start(TCPNetworkModule.java:75)    org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.internal.ClientComms$ConnectBG.run(ClientComms.java:521)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:724)  Caused by: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused    java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method)    java.net.AbstractPlainSocketImpl.doConnect(AbstractPlainSocketImpl.java:339)    java.net.AbstractPlainSocketImpl.connectToAddress(AbstractPlainSocketImpl.java:200)    java.net.AbstractPlainSocketImpl.connect(AbstractPlainSocketImpl.java:182)    java.net.SocksSocketImpl.connect(SocksSocketImpl.java:392)    java.net.Socket.connect(Socket.java:579)    org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.internal.TCPNetworkModule.start(TCPNetworkModule.java:66)  	... 2 more  {noformat}    Problem is, I still get them after undeploying my "mqtt | log" stream
R648. Not everyone may be familiar with MQTT, or esp. with MQTT inside Rabbit
R649. SingleNode server needs to stop cleanly with stopping both the admin server & container server.     Also, all the tests that require SingleNode main server needs to handle the server shutdown appropriately.
R650. As a user, I'd like to be notified when a exception is thrown in a module so that I can tap into an error channel to receive the failures for each stream/module.    
R651. Similar to what is done for e.g. hadoop, reactor, and http, some of the classes in the .x package (namely gemfire, splunk, twitter) should go in dedicated (albeit small) projects. This would enable further modularization (see XD-915)
R652. Remove ModuleType.getModuleTypeByTypeName.  All code should use the enum.  
R653. * In the testmodules.source  ** Rename source-config to packaged-source  ** Rename source-config to packaged-source-no-lib  * All xml files should be prefixed with test.  i.e. testsource, testsink  * Make sure all tests pass with new configuration
R654. The aggregate counter query result currently returns the interval that is passed in, whether it is aligned with the bucket resolution requested or not. It would be more intuitive if the time values returned are rounded (down) to the resolution of the query (i.e. whole minutes, hours, days or whatever).
R655. The runtime module properties requires a format option when displayed in the Shell     Based on the PR (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/340), the module properties are stored as String and displayed as is.  
R656. This is cause generally by someone having port 9100(hsqldb port) in use. It is recommended that setup checks to see if port is in use.  If it is throw an exception stating that hsqldb port (9100) is in use and suggest options like.  Free up the port or change the hsqldb port.
R657. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas/issues/89    Updating HATEOAS version and removing in a lot of controllers should be possible now. See eg https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/4919ea2498a13ef47aaa9437937308fb26a7a24f/spring-xd-dirt/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/dirt/rest/XDController.java#L219
R658. Register a JSON to Object converter in the DefaultContentTypeAwareConverterRegistry. Currently we only support Object to JSON but not the other way. This may or may not work for an arbitrary object but is useful in many cases.
R659. Currently TupleCodec uses JSON for serialization/deserialization. It should use Kryo. This will require some customization and potentially changes to Tuple to address the Tuple's conversionService field. 
R660. We need a way to find the runtime module info by module type("source", "sink", "processor", "job"). 
R661. Currently, ModulesController creates the ModuleDefinitionRepository instance with ModuleRegistry. Instead, we should inject the moduleDefinitionRepository into ModulesController directly.
R662. With PR#340, listing of runtime modules with a non-existent containerId will display empty table. Instead, we can throw exception saying Container doesn't exist.
R663. The RuntimeContainersController (from PR#340) returns the list of runtime modules. Instead we need make it pageable.
R664. Now that XD-924 is merged, we can convert splunk, twitter and gemfire modules to rely on the newly created projects.    The hadoop module will get its own story, as classpath handling is a bit more tricky for that one.    From there on, no new dependency should be added to DIRT for the sole purpose of a module. Rather, it should directly be created as a CP-aware module and project.
R665. If you create a simple "http | log" stream and list the modules, you'll see that JobPlugin adds its numberFormat, makeUnique, etc properties.  Even though they do no harm, it's really strange for users. Plus, it could conflict with e.g. activation of profiles given present properties
R666. There are a few obsolete classes lurking around, TypedJsonMapper comes to mind but there are likely some others
R667. See Epic https://jira.springsource.org/browse/XD-234
R668. SPI for deployment on to YARN + Local 'dirt' cluster.
R669. TBD
R670. Basically when I launch the spring-xd shell I can't interact with the namenode I receive security violations despite the fact that I try and set the proper configs. Authentication/Authorization (true/kerberos)  details of this issue can be found here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19258321/the-spring-xd-xd-shell-cant-run-the-hadoop-fs-ls-command-the-command-returns  
R671. Module options are currently implemented using PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer, doing simple "text" replacements.    This story proposes to introduce a richer model for module options, which could take the following xml representation (keeping in mind that there would be an underlying set of classes that could also apply to e.g. @Configuration approach):    {code:xml}  <xd:params>    <xd:param name="port" help="the http port to listen on" />  </xd:params>  {code}    So, the very first obvious benefit is providing help metadata.  The second one is an easy way to list available option names, without resorting to brittle PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer hacks (we wouldn't for example detect xd.stream.name or XD_TRANSPORT as a valid option)    One could also specify defaults/computations, this time benefiting from SpEL everywhere:  {code:xml}  <xd:params>    <xd:param name="directory" default="headers.directory" />  </xd:params>  {code}    Lastly, this opens the door to better type checking / combinations / optionality support:  {code:xml}  <xd:params valid="fixedDelay || cron">    <xd:param name="fixedDelay" type="int" />    <xd:param name="cron" type="string" />  </xd:params>  {code}    The 'valid' attribute can e.g. be evaluated by SpEL.    Some final remarks:  - That construct can be compatible with our current approach by behaving as a PropertySource itself (instead of creating a PropertySource, the StreamPlugin would give this new bean the java.util.Properties)  - Plugins could benefit from a hook in that construct and advertise the fact that they expect/provide new options (e.g. --inputType)    There is a slight problem though, which is that if this construct lives in the same AppContext as the module definition itself, then the AppContext needs to be refreshed for the logic to kick in. One could circumvent that using profiles, or we could rely on a different filename convention (e.g. <module>-params.xml)      
R672. Provide the infrastructure for HTTP GET /completions?start='http | file --d" that would return a list of possible completions (in this case returning the file option names that start with "d")    This story is about (and only about):  - Having that REST controller, delegating to some "CompletionsEngine"  - Implementing the Spring Shell Converter that talks to that    It's an empty shell, useless (but easy to do) without the actual "CompletionsEngine"
R673. This is currently missing and probably supersedes some of the stuff that's in there now.
R674. We have recently revised the syntax for stream definitions, this issue covers that refactoring.

R678. Currently ./gradlew clean test fails since the module dependencies are not packaged before the test task.  
R679. * Setup groups for xd user  * Setup privileges so users can only see their instances  * Setup user accounts  ** Send created access key to users  ** Send username and passwords to user  
R680. Add instructions to github wiki on the usage of the installer 
R681. * Logging into your XD Account For Example: https://946513944028.signin.aws.amazon.com/console * Discuss how to terminate running instances. ** Users can terminate all instances using the UI on the EC2 admin page * Usage monitoring via CloudWatch * Investigate what metadata in each instance is required so that cloudwatch can track 
R682. * The Application should  **  Create a Spring Application Context. **  Should take a command line parameter --config that will point to a property file with key/value pairs specified below.  By default the file xd-ec2.properties will be looked for on the classpath ** Associate EBS shared volume for each machine instance  * Packaging  ** Use gradle application plugin to generate a ‘bin’ directory with a script to start the application.  Seehttp://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/application_plugin.html ** The config file xd-ec2.properties should be in a directory (ideally a 'config' directory parallel to 'bin' and will be loaded by the application by default - loading via the CP is probably the easiest way. ** Create a POJO to easily reference these properties, vs. using a raw java Properties object.  How to verify it works  * Integration testing ** Create JUnit based tests.  JClouds itself has extensive testing, can look at those for structure. ** Verify what you created has been installed. ** Verify ports are open  Instance Information ** EBS of 50GB Base for each instance. * Report successful and failed Instances.  Key-Value pairs in configuration file properties may include:  * cluster-name= a name describing the cluster you are creating * aws-access-keys= the access key assigned to you by admin * aws-secret-key= the secret key assigned to you by admin * private-key-file= the private key file assigned to you by admin.

R683. *Update the Deployer class to add the following methods * ** RunningInstance  deployAdminServer  * The install script steps: ** Using XD-977 install distribution ** Setup XD_HOME variable ** start up redis and rabbit using ports as specified in xd-ec2.properties on admin server ** Create configurator directory ** Copy the configurator to containers ** Use port watch to make sure they started ** start admin server ** use port watch to make sure the admin started on 9393 ** Report if admin server started.  If it didn't start abort install. ** Report public DNS name of admin-server    * Integration Testing ** Verify XD admin has been started *** Create a basic stream (trigger>log)and make sure we get a success code from xd admin was received. *** Query the redis to see if the stream was created.  
R684. Automated test will use directly use the Deployer class  * asserts on basic info of RunningInstance  ** check that EBS was mounted  ** that application was unzipped  ** redis and rabbit are running via port checks    * http requests on admin port for   ** root path  ** list of modules  * @AfterClass that will look for the cluster name and terminate all instances  Look at ‘live’ tag in JClouds tests for some additional tactics  
R685. Get a java.io.File and copy it into HDFS.  Could be text or binary.  Write compressed with Hadoop and third party codecs   see: (XD-277, XD-279)  should initially support:  - bzip2    - LZO  
R686. we need the ability to run an XD cluster to get a handle on general issues and missing features based on running the system in a 'true' clustered environment.  We don’t need to make this an end-user facing feature in the short term, e.g. set a few keys in the shell and then install via a shell command. 
R687. * Create a Spring application context.  (XML or Java, dealers choice…)  * Use XD eclipse code format policy  * Create Source Package structure  * Create Test Package Structure  * Gradle build  * JClouds and Spring deps    
R688. * User specifies download distribution zip file from properties file.  See XD-969 for key-value pairs * Copy the distribution from the shared EBS/S3  the ebs volume assigned to the each node/admin instance  .   ** If not on shared ebs/s3 pull from http site specified by user and put on the shared EBS volume.  ** Unzip the distribution from on the ebs volume for the instance to the /home/ubuntu directory ** make sure privileges are set to ubuntu not root.   How to verify it works * Create a JUNit style integration test that ** Deletes a known .zip distribution from EBS/S3. ** Invoke the application functionality (should be a 1 liner) that will start up the instance and download the .zip distribution from the URI provided in xd-ec2.properties.  Verify the file is now in EBS/S3 and also on the instance ** Tear down created instance ** Create new instance passing in the same URI of the .zip distribution.  Verify as before 
R689. * Create a Deployer class has methods  ** RunningInstance  deploySingleNode  *** takes into account machine size as specified in properties file  ** void  destroyAllInstances()    *** or whatever JClouds returns from the destroy call  ** ctor gets passed in the root boostrapping credentials.  * Install Script Steps  ** Setup XD_HOME variable  ** Make sure privileges are set to ubuntu not root.  ** start up redis and rabbit using ports as specified in xd-ec2.properties  ** Use port watch to make sure they started  ** Start singlenode after configuration.  ** Display hostname of singlenode server  ** Report successful and failed startup  ** Hit root of xd-admin to see if there is a response on 9393  * Integration Testing  ** Verify that config files have been setup  ** Verify XD has been started  ** Verify XD can process a basic http post    
R690. *Update the Deployer class to add the following methods* * RunningInstance  deployContainer  * For each of the containers: ** Using XD-977 install distribution ** Setup XD_HOME variable ** Create configurator directory ** Copy the configurator to containers ** Run Configurators ** Verify that configuration files are setup correctly ** start container server ** Report if container started. (using jmx/Jolokia, if available) If it didn't start report failure but continue. ** Report public DNS name of container   * Integration Testing ** Verify that config files have been setup properly ** For each container: *** Verify container has been started *** Verify that container is working by creating a stream in admin (trigger|log).  Verify that the log on the container is being updated.  
R691. We used to have a shared guava-11.0.2.jar dependency in the lib dir. That's no longer there so hadoop distros that require this now fail (at least any hadoop 2.0.x based ones)    We should also upgrade to current Hadoop versions (Hadoop 2.2 stable)
R692. Create a sample batch job for inclusion in the distribution that will perform the following tasks.  ItemReader * Read a from a directory with multiple files (configurable) * Support for CSV (assume first line has header values) * Convert to tuple data structure ItemProcessor * Provide groovy based no-op ItemProcessor.  (configurable) ItemWriter * Write to JDBC. ** Provide  ** Assume there is an DB instance running somewhere, specify connection info (configurable)  **The sample job should be documented** 
R693. Same processing as XD-984, but the job instacne is launched via an event from the input file source.  Supporting a single file per job launch is OK.  > job create blah --definition "filehdfs"  > stream create csvStream --definition "file --ref=true --dir=/Users/luke --pattern=*.csv > job:blah"     *the job should be documented*
R694. Create a new tasklet implementation that will use the ANT globbing like syntax found in MultiItemResourceReader to specify the input files, and use FsShell to invoke a 'copyFromLocal' command with a specified HDFS output directory.  The batch job would call the tasklet.  *the job should be documented*
R695. The ItemReader will read multiple files from HDFS and the data will be converted to a tuple data structure The ItemProcessor will be a no-op groovy script. The ItemWriter will write the data to a MongoDB collection ** A TupleToDBObject converter will need to be developed.  *the sample job should be documented*
R696. Same setup as XD-987 for ItemReader and ItemProcessor, but should write to HDFS.      One can assume that the table structure has been created already external to the batch job execution.
R697. This is the inverse of XD-986 and will require creating a custom tasklet but with the input/output reversd.
R698. Support writing lines of text separated by a delimiter  Support writing a CSV (comma-separated variables), TSV (tab-separated variables),  No compression
R699. Need to support writing text in compressed format    should initially support:   - bzip2   - LZO
R700. Support for writing Sequence Files  Without Compression  Need a means to specify the key/value to be used 
R701. Support for using compression when writing Sequence Files  Either block or record-based compression. 
R702. Writing POJOs using Kite SDK 
R703. Some tests (esp. ModuleClasspathTests.testModuleWithClasspathAfterServerStarted) seem to fail because of a race condition.    Add a Hamcrest matcher that knows how to read the content of a FileSink|Source and refactor those to read like e.g.    assertThat(fileSink, eventually(hasContent("foo)))    
R704. Support for partitioning on a field, e.g. date.
R705. Need some sample usage, docs for     https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/tree/master/modules/source/gemfire     
R706. Related to https://jira.springsource.org/browse/BATCH-2109    DistributedJobService#listJobExecutionsForJob overrides   SimpleJobService#listJobExecutionsForJob    and does not include the *StepExecution*s. This is due to serializion issues with Jackson.     In order to fix this, we need to add a Jackson MixIn.  
R707. Create a tab view with tabs “Job Definitions�?, “Runtime Jobs�? (Deployed Jobs?, “Job Instances�? (Is Runtime Jobs a better name here?) and “Job Executions�?. On clicking “Job Definitions�? tab, we can have a table view of job definitions. Since we bootstrap.js, we can have a responsive table layout to list all the available job definitions. At the REST layer, “/jobs�? provides the list of job definitions. We can expand the JobsController list()’s QueryOptions to add more criteria (especially to list JobDefinition’s status (Deployed/Undeployed).  Also, this is the UI implementation for the shell command “job list�?  
R708. On clicking the “Deployed Jobs�?, we can have a table view of all the deployed jobs.  This is again a responsive table layout with all the job definitions with status “deployed�?. The deployed XD job corresponds to a single batch Job Instance.     This story addresses the UI layout changes to display existing JobInstance information.
R709. On clicking a specific job name in the deployed jobs list, we need to redirect the user to show the list of all the job executions on that job.  User should be able to navigate back to the deployed jobs list.
R710. From the Deployed jobs page, user should be able to click on the "Launch" button on a specific job and specify the Job parameters as key value pairs in the text box and we will convert that into JSON string as JobParameters into JobLaunch request.    
R711. From the Deployed jobs page, by clicking the "Schedule" button on a specific deployed job row, user should be able to schedule this job with:  1) Cron trigger (with cron expression) as a source to job launching named channel  2) Fixed rate/delay trigger as a source to job launching named channel    
R712. On clicking the “Executions” tab, user should see the list of all batch job executions. There should be options to filter job executions by few criteria such as by “Job name”, “execution time” etc., 
R713. On clicking "details" link on a job execution row, user should see the job details.    Job detail page will show all the information about the job, where as the table listing of jobs on the Execution tab may have omitted some columns or aggregated values to convey information more easily.
R714. On clicking the job detail page, we should display all the step executions associated with the specific job execution in a table view.
R715. Currently, the jobs definition list REST endpoint doesn't include deployed/undeployed status on a given job.
R716. Assumption: The batch job *wordCountJob* does not exist. Executing the REST endpoint:  http://localhost:9393/batch/jobs/wordCountJob/executions  yields the correct response:  {code} <errors xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"> <error logref="NoSuchBatchJobException"> <message> Batch Job with the name wordCountJob.job doesn't exist </message> </error> </errors> {code}  One could argue, though, that this is technically not an error but a status/application message, no??  However, the console/log logs at error level with a full stacktrace. I think the full stacktrace should only be available when debugging is allowed. In normal mode, I think we should log only at info or warn level without the full stacktrace. 
R717. See discussion at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/362
R718. When trying to use the --host command line parameter, spring shell reports the following error for this command, "xd-shell --host localhost" : Oct 25, 2013 10:35:25 AM org.springframework.shell.core.SimpleParser commandNotFound WARNING: Command '--host localhost' not found (for assistance press TAB) 
R719. Currently HSQLDB is the only option for batch jobs.  This should be configurable so that a user may select another JDBC data store option.      Steps:  * hsqldb.properties needs to be changed to batch-jdbc.properties  * hsql prefixes should be changed to batch-jdbc  * JDBC Connection String needs to be configurable  * JDBC Driver needs to be configurable  * The Setup Scripts to be used for spring batch need to be configurable.  * HSQLServerBean should be renamed to something batch-jdbc.properties    Tests:  Should be able write tests that support HSQLDB
R720. Create a reusable responsive UI layout to render the PagedResources returned from REST endpoint.     As part of this, try upgrading the bootstrap to 3.0.0 and use the responsive styles offered in it.
R721. Probably the cleanest approach is to provide a properties file in the xd config directory that enables this globally, e.g., json.pretty.print=true.  This will require some refactoring of the ModuleTypeConversion plugin, i.e., use DI in streams.xml
R722. Currently when you bring up a admin-ui on a browser that is not on the XD admin server, the page reports an error.    This is because the javascript is looking to localhost to get its updates.  
R723. When deploying jobs, the following code (line 103), hides the root cause of deployment failure:      if (exceptionClassName.equals(BEAN_CREATION_EXCEPTION) || exceptionClassName.equals(BEAN_DEFINITION_EXEPTION)) {      throw new MissingRequiredDefinitionException(definition.getName(), cause.getMessage());    }    For example:    org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.MissingRequiredDefinitionException: Error creating bean with name 'dataSourceInitializer' defined in file [/Users/luke/Work/spring-xd/build/dist/spring-xd/xd/modules/job/hdfsjdbc/config/hdfsjdbc.xml]: Cannot resolve reference to bean 'databasePopulator' while setting bean property 'databasePopulator'; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'databasePopulator' defined in file [/Users/luke/Work/spring-xd/build/dist/spring-xd/xd/modules/job/hdfsjdbc/config/hdfsjdbc.xml]: Initialization of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.NullPointerException    org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.JobDeployer.deploy(JobDeployer.java:103)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.JobDeployer.deploy(JobDeployer.java:67)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.rest.XDController.save(XDController.java:242)
R724. Log and purge bad messages
R725. ModuleDeployer has many methods with very similar names that are hard to understand.    Moreover, there is a substantial amount of duplicated code that should be extracted in sub methods with descriptive names.    One should even consider splitting the class    
R726. Create a composed module  Create a stream that uses that module  Try to undeploy the stream.  Kaboom    The dispatch is not correctly implemented in ModuleDeployer
R727. The module list command currently has a very simplistic two column display of (module name, module type). The is not very readable.  Switch to a 4 column display: (Sources, Processors, Sinks, Jobs)  Additionally, mark composed module [e.g. "myhttp (c)"]
R728. Job deployment currently goes through an overloaded version of deploy() that takes 4 parameters. This prohibits job handling code from benefiting from common behavior (and eg currently breaks deployAll)    Given that the 3 additional parameters are in fine handled as module parameters, let's push them to the job definition, known at creation time, rather than at deployment time (as it does not really make sense to change those between deploys)
R729. The current (XD) uses an inadequate {{MessageRedisSerializer}} when {{extractPayload}} is false (not currently being used). When porting this to SI, the serializer will be dropped.    Suggest creation of Kryo serializer for Messages for when Redis source/sinks are created.
R730. From XD-1023, the job status(deployed/undeployed) is available from JobInstance Repository and a job can be deployed/undeployed correctly.     Implement Job deploy/undeploy for a given job from JobDefinitions page and indicate status of the job definition (deployed/undeployed).
R731. The current admin UI uses bootstrap 3.0.0 which provides responsive design. We need to expand our scope to support all supported user agents.  This requires changes to use user agent specific layout for the UI views.
R732. This would be included in the OOTB batch jobs to optionally process the loaded Tuple with a configured script.
R733. Specify the default URL as:    {code}  urlRoot: location.protocol+'//'+location.hostname+(location.port ? ':'+location.port: '')  {code}
R734. Use a modal dialog to specify runtime parameters. There should be a little text are that gives hints as to the spring batch parameter key/value conventions, e.g. for type.  Might be a good idea to have a checkbox that lets you select to 'auto increment' job instance number.  4 columns key, value, type, identifying and an 'add parameter' button that adds a new row.  This would appear as a modal dialog box, polling of the state of the deployments would be suspended while the job parameter modal dialog box is shown.  
R735. * rename spring-xd-extension-hdfs to something else, as it seems it is all spring "data" stuff and is not coupled to xd. But leave it in extensions/ for now  * rename and move spring-xd-hadoop inside extensions (maybe to spring-xd-extension-hadoop (or hdfs))  * make hadoop related modules depend on the latter (which itself will depend on the former)
R736. Add a module that can act as a tcp *client* (as opposed to our current tcp module, which acts as a server, waiting for an incoming connection)    Also, the module should allow to send "commands" to the remote server. The typical minimal case for such a protocol is to send "PING" messages, but a stateful mechanism should be put in place for more complex cases.
R737. This relates to XD-871 which provides a good scenario.     >stream create s1 --definition "http | log --deploy"   >stream create s2 --definition "http | log --deploy"    The second command results in an error message that the port is in use but the stream definition is still saved. Since create + deploy is a logical unit of work, it should follow transactional semantics. In other words if the deploy fails, the repository should be rolled back (or a compensating destroy should be performed).  Note this should not be handled the same way if create and deploy happen separately. In that case, the stream definition should remain.
R738. As per discussion, any attempt to create something that would collide with existing should fail:    II) Attempt to create a composed module with same name as an already existing, not composed module, with same type  should fail (EB, MF)  should work and shadow previous module from now on    III) Attempt to create a composed module with same name as an already existing composed module, with same type  should fail (EB, MF)  should work and shadow previous module from now on  should work and retroactively change definitions of streams with that module  
R739. Provided it is not currently used in any stream:    V) Attempt to destroy a composed module  Should not be supported at all  Should not be supported if involved in at least one stream (EB?, MF!)  Should be supported and have no other consequences whatsoever (see IV) (EB?)  Should be supported and invalidate/destroy streams involving it  
R740. With the following semantics (assuming http | filter | transform composition):      * Fully qualified names always available (eg filter.expression)     * using module type as key     * or label if ambiguity  * Simple names available if no ambiguity (eg here "port" refers to http.port)    As per discussion:    VIII) Use of “--expression�? option in composed module “filter | filter�?  Should not be supported (require FQN always)  Should pertain to first filter module (always)  Should pertain to all modules with an “expression�? option (here: both filters)  Should fail if not qualified and ambiguity. Use label.expression (or type.expression, eg if we had “filter | transform) (see VII ⇒ nesting1.nesting2.nesting3.expression) (MF)    VIII) Use of “--expression�? option in composed module “http | filter --expression=something | transform�?  Should not be supported (already valued)  Should pertain to first filter module (always)  Should pertain to all modules with an “expression�? option (here: both filters)  Should fail if not qualified and ambiguity. Use label.expression (or type.expression, eg if we had “filter | transform) (see VII ⇒ nesting1.nesting2.nesting3.expression) (MF)  
R741. Although composition of a module out of an already composed module seems to work at the 'module compose' level, trying to deploy a stream with that more complex module fails with      org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol$AbstractConnectionHandler.process(AbstractProtocol.java:589)    org.apache.tomcat.util.net.JIoEndpoint$SocketProcessor.run(JIoEndpoint.java:312)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:724)  Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: each module before the last must provide 'output'    org.springframework.util.Assert.notNull(Assert.java:112)    org.springframework.xd.module.CompositeModule.initialize(CompositeModule.java:132)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.module.ModuleDeployer.deploy(ModuleDeployer.java:234)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.module.ModuleDeployer.deployModule(ModuleDeployer.java:224)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.module.ModuleDeployer.handleCompositeModuleDeployment(ModuleDeployer.java:180)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.module.ModuleDeployer.handleMessageInternal(ModuleDeployer.java:129)    org.springframework.integration.handler.AbstractMessageHandler.handleMessage(AbstractMessageHandler.java:73)  	... 63 more
R742. See the discussion in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/370    There are now various superseded classes and tests which we no longer need.
R743. Make sure the sinks and jobs work against Pivotal HD 1.1
R744. The ModuleOptions PR currently uses FQN for types (eg java.lang.String)    Would be nice to have support for short names for common types, both in the properties files and the annotation
R745. Currently the parser returns a List<ModuleDeploymentRequest>, and the deployer works with that list directly. We need a higher level parser result (e.g. DeployableStream - or probably a better name after some thought) that can encapsulate that list while also enabling metadata to be added. That metadata may be helpful for composite module information as well as the module dependencies of a given stream (including any composed modules within that stream).
R746. see comments on this PR (which is part of the code that needs to be refactored):  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/390  
R747. this would elminate dependencies that are currently in the codebase, such as:  * RESTModuleType and ModuleType enums * ModuleOption and DetailedModuleDefinitionResource.Option  
R748. Currently the aggregate counter aggerates by the current time. However the data may already have a timestamp in it (eg streams from activity events on a website).   It would be useful as an alternative approach to be able to specify this field to aggregate on.     This would have the following benefits:    1) The aggregate counts would be more accurate as they would reflect the acutal event times and not have any lag from an intermediate messgaging system they might have passed through.  2) If for whatever reason XD is down, comes back up and starts pulling queued messages from the messaging system the aggregate counter will reflect the correct event time. Currently you would get a gap and then a spike as a backlog of messages would get allocated to the current aggregate count.  3) Old data could be rerun through XD still creating the correct aggregate counts.    Configuration would be something like     stream create --name mytap --definition "tap:mystream > aggregatecounter --name=mycount --timestampField=eventtime"    without the timestampfield it would behave as currently. 
R749. This would be a combination of the existing aggregate counter and field value counter functionality.  For example if the stream data was for car purchases some fields might be colour, make and model.  When analysing the aggregate data I dont just want to know how many were sold on Monday, but how many of each make or how many of each colour,  or how many of a particular colour, make AND model. This would allow a dashboard type client to 'drill down' into each dimension or combination of dimensions (in real time without executing batch queries against the raw data)  Ideally the aggregate counter would be specified as   stream create --name mytap --definition "tap:mystream > aggregatecounter --name=mycount --fieldNames=colour,make,model"  The keys would be dynamically created according to the field values in each record (ie in a similar way to the field value counter you would not need to predefine field values) and keys would be created for all combinations of the fields specified eg the record   { "colour":"silver" , "make":"VW" , "model" : "Golf" }   would increment the following key counters (in addtion to the existing time buckets)  <existing base counter - ie all fields for this time bucket> colour:black make:VW model:Golf colour:black.make:VW colour:black.model:Golf make:VW.model:Golf colour:black.make:VW.model:Golf  ie the actual keys would look something like  aggregatecounters.mycount.make:VW.model:Golf.201307 etc  This may seem like it would generate a lot of key combinations but in practice the data generated will still be massively less than the raw data, and keys will only be created if that combination occurs in a time period.  Also some fields may be dependent on each other (such as make and model in the above example) so the amount of possibilites for those composite keys would be a lot less that the number of one times the number of the other.  
R750. note from PR #365 - which has been merged - providing the initial level of support...    Pending issues (to be addressed in another PR?):  - [x] complex case  - [x] default values for complex case, when option is not surfaced back to the module (eg "suffix" in our canonical example)  - [ ] plugin provided options and values  - [ ] descriptive defaults instead of actual defaults (e.g. \<use stream name\>)  - [ ] JSR303 Validation    
R751. note from PR #365:    {quote}  We should probably create a new story to (at least) rename "module display" to "module showconfig" or something, but possibly even reconsider it altogether. In some sense, it's even violating the encapsulation of ModuleRegistry. It wont work for java-config style modules or spring-integration Groovy DSL modules. Personally, if anything, I'd rather see those config files themselves exposed as part of an admin UI. What you are doing with the options here fits better with the encapsulation principle and the fact that typical usage should not require detailed knowledge of the actual underlying configuration of a Module.  {quote}    
R752. e.g. see comment on PR #390:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/390/files#r7563787    In that case, it's "delete" in one place and "destroy" in another. There are other cases as well.
R753. This will allow for some easy demonstration of how 'HATEOS' works via links in our REST API.  There are probably some quite useful commands here that could be used from the Spring Data REST shell longer term, but a good place to take a look at now.    Goal is to show how metrics such as counters are accessible w/o having to switch tabs to use wget.  The pretty printing of the returned JSON is an important feature to help understand the response, this functionality can be taken from/reused from the Spring Data REST shell
R754. The deployment tab does not reflect the current state of the jobs.  User must hit browser refresh button to make it work.
R755. I know that the feature is not ready, but we either should post a message to the user that the feature is not available or hide the button
R756. Job gets a empty key:value pair when launching the job from the admin-ui.
R757. The table background color on the Job Definition Tab is green while the others tabs have a white background.  They should be consistent.
R758. Currently, the bootstrap.less file has all the styles that the bootstrap supports. But we should only add/compile the LESS that are needed by XD UI.
R759. The batch job's step execution count is retrieved from org.springframework.batch.admin.web.JobExecutionInfo in batch job repository.    But, the JobExecutionInfo always have the stepExecutionCount set to '0'.
R760. (apologies if a ticket already exists for this, but I didn't see one)    I spun up the Hortonworks Data Platform 2.0 sandbox, but see it isn't supported by Spring XD yet.    How hard would it be to add these Distro's in?  Is it just a matter of dropping in a lib folder for hadoop22 and/or hdp20, and allowing those and options to be passed in via the --hadoopDistro option?    I'm currently trying to work through the following tutorial, but using the HDP 2.0 sandbox instead of the 1.3 sandbox    http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/using-spring-xd-to-stream-tweets-to-hadoop-for-sentiment-analysis/    Thanks!
R761. Looks like we need to spend a cycle on Asciidoc - as we still have the author-tag-issue - I thought we can simply upgrade the asciidoctor-gradle-plugin to 0.7.0 (currently 0.4.1) but that breaks the docs being generated.
R762. Add debug flag for logging globally maybe or else --trace per command?
R763. Use of dot in property name prevents the user from specifying a value in stream definition  Also, defaults are repeated at .xml and .properties level
R764. for example, the following should work:    {code}  xd:>stream create a1 --definition "queue:a > transform --expression=payload+'-a' | log"  Created new stream 'a1'    xd:>stream create b1 --definition "queue:b > transform --expression=payload+'-b' | log"  Created new stream 'b1'    xd:>stream create s1 --definition "http | router --expression=payload.contains('a')?'queue:a':'queue:b'"  Created new stream 's1'    xd:>http post --data "ha"  > POST (text/plain;Charset=UTF-8) http://localhost:9000 ha  > 200 OK    // log shows: "ha-a"    xd:>http post --data "hi"  > POST (text/plain;Charset=UTF-8) http://localhost:9000 hi  > 200 OK    // log shows: "ha-b"  {code}    This needs to be tested against all transports (local, redis, and rabbit)  
R765. This is most likely an issue for any transport, since it's probably happening within the JobPlugin, but I noticed when using Rabbit that every stream I created also triggered creation of "job:[streamname]" Queues.
R766. This needs to work for all transports (local, rabbit, and redis), and we need to ensure that we have test coverage for each of those to avoid any regressions.    The incorrect behavior was observed with all three transports:    {code}  xd:>stream create a --definition "topic:foo > transform --expression=payload+'-a' | log"  Created new stream 'a'    xd:>stream create b --definition "topic:foo > transform --expression=payload+'-b' | log"  Created new stream 'b'    xd:>stream create s --definition "http > topic:foo"  Created new stream 's'    xd:>http post --data hi  > POST (text/plain;Charset=UTF-8) http://localhost:9000 hi  > 200 OK    // only one line in log!  {code}  
R767. This is "harmless" (the attempt to brpop continues even after the connection itself has been closed), but ugly:    {code}  12:45:15,084 ERROR redisInboundAdapter-redis:queue-inbound-channel-adapter1 inbound.RedisQueueMessageDrivenEndpoint:181 - Failed to execute listening task.

R768. The batch job for File to HDFS will try to check for the default '/data/' directory even if the target directory in HDFS is something else.  If the /data directory isn't there, the job will fail.    This should be fixed so there isn't a check on the directory that isn't the final HDFS target directory and the target directory should be created if it doesn't exist.
R769. The File to HDFS batch job will not close the file being written to in HDFS when the job completes.  The ItemWriter for HDFS needs to incorporate functionality that is present in the standard FlatFileWriter, perhaps inheriting from AbstractItemStreamItemWriter
R770. Add a bridge module per XD-956 to support definitions like topic:foo > queue:bar . Convenient for testing for XD-1066
R771. Change the default port since it conflicts with the default port for the http source
R772. Summary says it all. When starting, we now get {noformat} SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings. SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/ebottard/.gradle/caches/artifacts-24/filestore/org.slf4j/slf4j-log4j12/1.7.5/jar/6edffc576ce104ec769d954618764f39f0f0f10d/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.5.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class] SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/ebottard/.gradle/caches/artifacts-24/filestore/org.slf4j/slf4j-log4j12/1.6.1/jar/bd245d6746cdd4e6203e976e21d597a46f115802/slf4j-log4j12-1.6.1.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class] SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.

R773. Migrating to boot dropped the XD banner and its info.  Can be restored using eg a boot Initializer and removing the default boot banner
R774. This is along the lines of what is in this blog post    http://coreyreil.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/spring-batch-creating-an-ftp-tasklet-to-get-remote-files/    Note that there have been some new developments in SI to get at the underlying stream for FTP.    The way to test this is to create a new batch job in XD that has this as it's tasklet.  Going forward the target file system will also be HDFS.
R775. Develop out a Proof of concept for review that allows users to easily create a new module to Spring XD. Key features to be enabled:    1. Allow existing modules to be included as a classpath dependency  2. Consolidate shared libraries in existing modules (e.g. a shared lib for all gemfire modules)  3. User develops a module as a normal Java project  4. User's project can then be added to a runtime container in the same way (as a dependency)    Nice to have:     1. at development time container can run continuously and pick up changes from user's module project.  2. Java config for a module.  3. command line functionality to create project scaffolding.    
R776. Without the directory, Spring XD cannot be imported into STS using its own Gradle support.
R777. BatchJobsController.listForJob should be 'executionsForJob'  BatchJobsController.jobInstances should be 'instancesForJob'    The JavaDoc for the class and each method should be more descriptive about their functionality      
R778. The automatic deployment of the job makes it harder to understand the lifecycle of the job and also does not allow for the opportunity to define any additional deployment metadata for how that job runs, e.g is it partitioned etc.
R779. This should go in the first section of the Batch Job documentation.    Here is a rough suggestion    The lifecycle of a job in XD.    1. Register a job module with the MoudleRegistry by putting a XML/jar files in the $XD_HOME/modules/jobs directory.  2. Create a job definition from a job module by providing a name and properties that apply to all job instances can be configured at this point.  The job is not yet deployed  3. Deploy the job to an xd-container.  A job instance can not be created by sending a message to a job queue that contains optional runtime job parameters  4. Launch a job by sending a message to the job queue with job parametres.  A Job Instance is created, representing a specific run of the job.  A Job Instance is the Job Definition plus the runtime job parameters.  You can query for the Job Instances associated with a given job name  5. The job is executed creating a Job Exection object that captures the success or failure of the job.  You can query for the Job Executions associated with a given job name.  6. Undeploy a job.  This removes the job from xd-container.
R780. Adopted functionality from Spring Batch admin Should include springmvc test framework style tests  GET /batch/jobs/executions/{executionId} - Get information on all executions of a given job name.
R781. Adopted functionality from spring batch admin Should include springmvc test framework style tests  GET /batch/jobs/executions/{executionId}/steps - Get information on all steps of a given job execution
R782. Functionality adopted from spring batch admin Should include springmvc test framework style tests  GET /batch/jobs/executions/{executionId}/steps/{stepId} - Get information on a given step execution
R783. Functionality adopted from spring batch admin Should include springmvc test framework style tests  DELETE /batch/jobs/executions/{executionId} Stop a specific job
R784. Adopted functionality from spring batch admin  Should include SpringMVC test framework style tests.    DELETE /batch/jobs/executions/ - stop all job executions
R785. Functionality adopted from spring-batch admin  Should include springmvc test framework style tests    POST /batch/jobs/{jobName}/{jobInstanceId}/executions - restart a specific job instance    
R786. There is a NPE in the current spring batch admin functionality.    Should be springmvc test framework style tests.    GET /batch/jobs/executions/{jobExecutionId}/steps/{stepExecutionId}/progress
R787. Currently, the BatchJobsController and BatchJobExecutionsController are not HATEOAS compliant and we need make them so.
R788. The way we now include various Hadoop distributions is cumbersome to maintain. Need a better way of managing and isolating these dependencies on a module level rather than container level.
R789. Currently you can specify negative pageSize values - The controllers should validatate that. Right now an internal exception is being return, leaking internal details to the caller -   E.g.:   **http://localhost:9393/batch/executions?pageSize=-1** results in:  {code} <errors> <error logref="BadSqlGrammarException"> <message> StatementCallback; bad SQL grammar [SELECT TOP -1 E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID, E.START_TIME, E.END_TIME, E.STATUS, E.EXIT_CODE, E.EXIT_MESSAGE, E.CREATE_TIME, E.LAST_UPDATED, E.VERSION, I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID, I.JOB_NAME FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION E, BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE I WHERE E.JOB_INSTANCE_ID=I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID ORDER BY E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID DESC]; nested exception is java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: user lacks privilege or object not found: TOP </message> </error> </errors> {code}  
R790. There is a need for a persistent store for messages so that they can survive the crash of a container node.  The redis implementation in SI is useful since users may already be using redis for other features such as analytics.    This module would sit alongside the current in-memory based aggregator.  It brings in redis as a dependency and there should be configuration options exposed so that one can use a different version of redis as compared to the one that maybe used for analytics.      Due to the need to have redis on the CP, and the large number of different options that each message store implementation provides and the different 3rd party library dependencies, I would like to avoid going down the path of using a profile here as it would seem to go beyond what we had discussed for profile support.  We can revisit as the module contribution story based on boot unfolds.
R791. Similar to XD-1100.  SI has the jdbc based message store.    <int-jdbc:message-store id="messageStore" data-source="dataSource"      table-prefix="MY_INT_"/>    The configuration of this aggregator would be configured so that it uses an embedded database, hsqldb or H2 depending if there is any real perf benefit to one or the other, and store the data on the local file system.
R792. would be good to have a general feel for the general performance of these two options.  Redis can run on the same node as the benchmark.
R793. The JDBC sink is broken. Simple "time | jdbc" results in:    org.springframework.jdbc.BadSqlGrammarException: PreparedStatementCallback; bad SQL grammar [insert into test (payload) values(?)]; nested exception is java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: user lacks privilege or object not found: TEST    Looks like some config options got clobbered during bootification. 
R794. Would be nice to have some kind of regression testing on the jdbc sink, as it becomes more prominent in XD.    Use of an in memory db where we expose eg a JdbcTemplate to assert state
R795. Even though it may be hard to come up with a mqtt broker, an easy test that should be automated is    somesource | mqtt --topic=foo    with     mqtt --topics=foo | somesink      And asserting that what is emitted to somesource ends up in somesink.    
R796. Basic inverse of current hdfsjdbc job.
R797. Currently, the tests use instantiated DistributedJobService object instead of a simple mock. We can just use mock object for the tests.
R798. Restore --foo=bar as well as --foo bar    Validation of values should be done as a separate story
R799. Wherever they come from (cmd line args or ENV_VARS), options such as transport, analytics, etc should be validated and issues should be reported to users
R800. Currently, the JobRepoTests use the same batch job repository that the XD runtime uses. Since the batch job repo doesn't delete the job instances, there would be stale data from this test. 
R801. The following keys remain after running the test suite:  {code} redis 127.0.0.1:6379> keys * 1) "containers" 2) "containers.application:9292" {code}  
R802. ApplicationContext ID generation is difficult in general.  Cloud Foundry solves this problem for us by providing unique instance ids to all running instances of an app. I don't suppose that helps much in the general case though, and we need something (a rule of thumb) that is unique and preferably deterministic, so that nodes retain their ID across process and connector restarts.  In Cloud Foundry the instance id plays a vital role (and will be automatically picked up by the app and applied - need to look at how that plays in a context hierarchy). User can set the context id manually using {{spring.application.name}} and {{spring.application.index}}.
R803. We have observed in unit tests (see AbstractSingleNodeStreamIntegrationTests) that(Redis/SingleNode) occasionally fail. The root cause must be investigated further but there is some evidence to suggest that the control messages (ModuleDeploymentRequests) are not always received and handled by the ModuleDeployer. This does not produce an error but results in runtime stream failures. This problem may be resolved as part of the planned Deployment SPI but is being tracked here until we are certain that it has been resolved.
R804. We no longer validate the --hadoopDistro options in the xd scripts. Seem sthe classes doing this validation were removed for boot.  We do this validation in the xd-shell script
R805. We need to create a shell script that calls the batch DB creation sql files for the JDBC option selected.  
R806. We should we centrally standardize on date/time formats so that we don't create inconsistencies, and follow ISO 8601 internally. Internally we should only work with UTC (or make that the default config option).    Ultimately, whatever the user sees is just a formatting concern.
R807. 2 forces at heand here: * Spring binding/validation itself * jsr303 (for eg @NotNull)
R808. Following merge of XD-1109.    See discussion at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/commit/eaf886eab3b2ef07da55575029ccabb2c8a36af9#commitcomment-4701947
R809. Example:  {noformat}  xd:>module delete --name sink:file  12:31:19,495  WARN Spring Shell client.RestTemplate:566 - DELETE request for "http://localhost:9393/modules/sink/file" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler  Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Cannot delete non-composed module sink:file  {noformat}    The WARN log is redundant with the command result and should be silenced
R810. Following merge of XD-953, provide module options using the "simple" approach where applicable
R811. This is a very big story, needs some planning/discussion before starting work.  Should be able to be implemented as a plugin. 
R812. This could be inside gradlew or a .settings file.
R813. EC2 Deployer   Needs to change its configuration behavior to use environment variables vs. the property files  * Remove ConfigureSystem class, since we will use environment variables instead  * Allow users to set environment variables via the xd-ec2 properties.  * If properties are not present use those that are available in the application.yml  * Utilize JClouds environment variable setup features to implement this behavior.
R814. Pending a better approach and extension point (see XD-1050), provide a way to factor out common recurring options for modules:  * inputType  * outputType  * job parameters
R815. As a Spring XD user I need to listen on a JMS Topic and ingest the messages, so I can process the messages.    Currently the module only allows for Queues
R816. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/415#issuecomment-29024329    This test should be created so that it reproduces the failure and then turned off, so that when we switch to the new HDFS writing code    
R817. * need to add a -Dxd.home=$XD_HOME to the start scripts else all files will write to the /logs directory.  * Need to update .bat files to use % for env variables instead of $.  * Need to rename logger.config to logging.config so that boot will pick up the log config files.  * Admin needs to use xd-admin-logger configs instead of xd-container-logger  * Renamed logging file for singlenode from admin.log to singlenode.log
R818. This causes intermittent test failures when testing streams with other transports since ModuleDeployer receives duplicate requests from multiple threads. Fix is to check for local transport before invoking setUpControlChannels()
R819. When a ModuleOption is backed by an enum, change the (currently String) type representation to be the possible values  ie java.lang.String -> String but traffic.Light -> Red | Green | Orange
R820. For several Batch Job related JSON endpoints, we serialize too much information.
R821. Each node in the cluster advertises itself and the admin node listens to these ads and creates groups out of them.  The deployment of jobs and stream processing can then be deployed onto a specific group and specific nodes within the group.  The project https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-grid is the start of this model.
R822. Base matching algorithm on the model used in http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/   Jobs/Stream - specify their requirements and preferences Nodes - specify their requirements and preferences  e.g.    A job/stream module "requires" a linux x85-64 platform and "prefers" the machine with the most free memory  A node "requires" that only only can run jobs when there is 25% or more free memory and it "prefers" to run stream modules over job modules.  The requirements and preferences are represented as SpEL expressions in a "Advertisement" data structure.  There is a 'require' expression and a 'preference' expression.   Matching occurs between Node Ads and Job/Stream Ads so that the requirements of both Ads evaluate to true and the matching nodes are ranked according to the preference expression.  The Job/Streams Ads can make use of well defined attributes about the nodes, such as it's memory/cpu usage.
R823. The initial parsing of a stream/job definitions into a list of ModuleDeploymentRequests needs to be transformed into a Physical Deployment Model that takes into account     1) module co-location  2) partitioning  3) number of instances  4) node assignment    an potentially other data related to the runtime properties of a module (e.g. concurrency settings)     The an external DeploymentManifest will be used to capture this information.    A deployment of a stream or job will then need to optionally provide a reference to deployment manifest.
R824. The TriggerSourceOptionsMetadata class should be able to use an actual Date object, thanks to Spring binding conversion.  BUT, the ${date} construct will receive a toString version of it. Make sure this works properly
R825. Currently local is not a supported data transport for the container. It should be an option. Note that local is not valid for control transport for a standalone container. So we need to revisit the current semantics that default the control transport to be the same as the data transport, i.e. ,--transport=local should fail. 
R826. As a system administrator I need to connect to SonicMQ as jms provider    When setting up the correct spring xml file and added the correct jar files to the lib directory I received the following

R827. Instead of using jobExecutionId and stepExecutionId as two separate options for the "job execution step progress" command, we can have a single option with id mentioned as (jobExecutionId:stepExecutionId)
R828. Support all available options
R829. Trigger has been changed to be one single modules, taking params (as opposed to 3 before)    Update doc at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Batch-Jobs    Also, arguably, the module could be advertised as a source itself (it is only mentioned in the context of batch)

R831. Currently, the JobPlugin extends AbstractPlugin and the AbstractPlugin has got lots of unused code (like it doesn't do anything with preProcessSharedContext()) in there. 
R832. Create a script to sanity check JMS and MQTT
R833. This should be quite straightforward, since the Spring Data Mongo jars are already included. We have this working by just adding the attached sink context file and the spring-integration-mongodb jar.    (This works for JSON string streams, but a mongo converter probably needs added to support Tuple conversion)  
R834. We should standardize on the options between modules:  idleTimeout - timeout rolloverSize - rollover  Also, need to standardize on unit used for timeout - should this be s or ms? 
R835. Need to check for existing files with the same file counter
R836. Current implementation of column option of JDBC sink convert underscore to java property name. If database column contains underscore, there is no way to store data.  So JdbcMessagePayloadTransformer should not use JdbcUtils.convertUnderscoreNameToPropertyName even if column contains "_".
R837. The Gemfire CQ source needs some enhancements:  * enable locator configuration * consider decoupling from JSON. Currently designed to work with gemfire-json-server to avoid dependence on specific domain objects on the client and server side. So produces json strings from PdxInstance(s) stored in the cache.  
R838. Test case is here:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/src/test/scripts/basic_stream_tests#L49  We would expect one message in the counter, but get 3.
R839. Current implementation of JDBC sink module insert data into "payload" column. But I can't just change the default column "payload" to something else using --columns option. Because JdbcMessagePayloadTransformer compare the columnName to "payload" and it hard coded.   
R840. Splunk sink module doesn't work at all. It throws java.lang.VerifyError exception like following.  nested exception is java.lang.VerifyError: class org.springframework.integration.splunk.outbound.SplunkOutboundChannelAdapter overrides final method onInit.()V  This is because SplunkOutputChannelAdapter refers old spring integration jar, but recent AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler (which SplunkOutputChannelAdapter extends) set final to onInit method. Hence it doesn't work.  SplunkOutboundChannelAdapter should be fixed to not override onInit method and replace the jar file spring-integration-splunk-1.0.0.M1.jar.
R841. XD container's id is set to use its application context id which is derived from:    ${vcap.application.name:${spring.application.name:${spring.config.name:application}}}:${vcap.application.instance_index:${spring.application.index:${server.port:${PORT:null}}}}    With the *default* values[the PORT is not set and embedded tomcat uses local port], the launcher id is set to "application:0"    When I have multiple launchers then all the launchers have the same id as "application:0" which doesn't seem correct.    Do we need to use the Id that is generated at the XDContainer's constructor here?    public XDContainer() {  		this.id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();  	}    
R842. Expected benefits are  --key<space>value as well as --key=value on the command line (eg XD-1108)    nice usage screen   
R843. If I fiddle with the testTappingWithLabels method I can reproduce the same issue:    HttpSource source = newHttpSource();    FileSink sink = newFileSink().binary(true); FileSink tapsink1 = newFileSink().binary(true); stream().create("myhttp", "%s | flibble: transform  --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | flibble2: transform  --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | %s", source, sink); stream().create("mytap4", "tap:stream:myhttp.flibble > transform  --expression=payload.replaceAll('A','.') | %s", tapsink1); source.ensureReady().postData("Dracarys!");    assertThat(sink, eventually(hasContentsThat(equalTo("DRACARYS!"))));    assertThat(tapsink1, eventually(hasContentsThat(equalTo("DR.C.RYS!"))));      java.lang.AssertionError:  Expected: "DR.C.RYS!", trying at most 10 times        but: failed after 10*100=1000ms:  "DR.C.RYS!DR.C.RYS!",  
R844. The current behavior when there are "global" external defaults to module options is to set them in the placeholder construct: ${foo:${the_default}} where ${the_default} is sourced from some properties file.  The downside is that the module options infrastructure is unaware of them.  Provide support for such defaults (at least when using PojoModuleOptions) in the form of  * Annotate a field (or the setter?) with @Value("${the_default}") * (maybe) Annotate the pojo with @PropertySource to indicate the location of the properties file * (maybe) come up with a general naming scheme for the properties file
R845. Update dependencies to spring-data-hadoop 2.0.0.M4
R846. Labels should only be used help uniquely identify a module in a stream.  The stream definition a | x: b | x: c | d should throw an error since the label x is applied to two modules.  Also ambiguity exists with a stream definition such as   http | transform | transform | filter | hdfs  since a module with the name 'transform' will exist twice, meaning a tap on transform will result in message from both transform modules.  To make the naming unique and the usage with taps, the following naming strategy is proposed demonstrated by example.  http | transform | transform | filter | hdfs http, transform.0, transform.1, filter, hdfs  If a use tries to tap on transform, an error would be shown saying that  you could try to tap on transform.0 or transform.1 or alternatively use labels.  http | transform | filter | transform | hdfs http, transform.0, filter, transform.1, hdfs  http | x: transform | filter | transform | hdfs http, x, filter, transform, hdfs  
R847. This has happened more than once, where a node fails for whatever reason, and when it is restarted, it does not receive requests from the admin server.  This could be file handle count based.  Since this is not Rabbit as a transport I'm not chasing this down yet.  But felt it needed to be recorded.
R848. However this is triggered (depending on whether https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/477/files is merged yet or not), jmx seems to be broken because of duplicate beans / mbeans names
R849. When using @Value for providing a default value in a module options POJO, make it so that the REST API (and hence the module info command) advertises that   1) the expression was ${foo.something} 2) to the best extent possible (value may come from another property source), tell which config file it came from (introspecting the @PropertySource annotation)
R850. Update to spring-data-hadoop 2.0.0.M5 when it is released and remove the temporary DatasetTemplateAllowingNulls in spring-xd-hadoop  We should also review the supported hadoop distros - think we should support anything that is current/stable: - hadoop12 - hadoop22 - phd1 (PHD 1.1) - hdp13 - hdp20 - cdh4 
R851. Changed field back to topic
R852. When exporting of MBeans are enabled via XD_JMX_ENABLED (also, jmxEnabled as in application.yml), the Admin and Lancher server application fail to start.

Since spring boot (by default) looks for property sources from file:./config/application.yml and file:./application.yml    In XD bundles, the CLASSPATH of our XD startup scripts'(admin, container, singlenode startup scripts) set to use APP_HOME and APP_HOME/config.    But, if we have an application.yml fragment on $APP_HOME/config, then it is considered as classpath resource and the actual "application.yml" (from dirt lib/ classpath) is not loaded.     Also, we need to separate out the properties files we have inside $APP_HOME/config as by default, boot uses "config" directory as well.
R855. --transport as an alias for --controlTransport
R856. We need to add ModuleOptions support for Rabbit sink.
R857. Currently RabbitMQ sink module's connection properties could not be overridden by "${xd.config.home}/${configProperties:rabbit}.properties" even if "local-override" is set to true.    It looks like the AmqpTemplate used by the AMQP outbound channel adapter doesn't use the connection factory defined in the sink module.
R858. The PropertyResolver needs to follow the below precedence order on PropertySources when resolving the module properties:    From lowest to the highest order,    0 application.yml  1 applicaiton.yml fragment  2 property placeholders  2a  property placeholder under 'shared' config directory   2b property placeholder under module/(source/sink/processor)/config directory  3. environment variables  4. system properties  5. command line      
R859. The jdbc sink deletes existing table and creates a single column payload one even if properties file has 'initializeDatabase=false'
R860. Add docs to section     https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Batch-Jobs#pre-packaged-batch-jobs
R861. If we have default values from Container/Admin options, then they can not be overridden by the system properties or system environment.     Currently, the only default we have for the Container/Admin options is for "jmxEnabled" option and since it is a boolean it can never be overridden by sys/env property XD_JMX_ENABLED.    I think we need to make sure there are no default values assigned for the non-boolean Container/Admin options and handle the boolean type option separately.
R862. see discussion at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/commit/2f0e80b5e337b71c9c70de510a44d2f050d10fa7
R863. The batch jobs use different defaults compared to some of the sink/source modules.    filehdfs puts data in a /data directory with files named after the stream using a .log file extension. The hdfs sink puts files in an /xd/<streamname> directory using .txt as the default file extension.    filehdfs needs a more descriptive naming
R864. In the shell:  job launch doesn't do completion of --name, this is different behavior compared to job destroy  typing 'job destroy' and hitting tab completes with '--name'  typing 'job launch' and hitting tab does nothing
R865. This works:  {code} job launch helloSpringXD --params "{"myStringParameter":"foobar","secondParam":"hello"}" {code}  This fails:  {code} job launch helloSpringXD --params "{"myStringParameter":"foobar", "secondParam":"hello"}" {code}  Notice the space between the parameters. This fails with:  {code} spring> job launch helloSpringXD --params "{"myStringParameter":"foobar", "secondParam":"hello"}" 14/01/06 12:00:07 WARN client.RestTemplate: PUT request for "http://localhost:9393/jobs/helloSpringXD/launch" resulted in 500 (Internal Server Error); invoking error handler  Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: org.springframework.integration.MessageHandlingException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to convert provided JSON to Map<String, Object>  {code}  Internally the parameters are parsed to:  {code} {"myStringParameter":"foobar",secondParam":"hello"} {code}  The curly brace is missing.  
R866. filejdbc throws an exception:   {code}  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve resource location pattern [/mycsvdir/*.csv]: class path resource [mycsvdir/] cannot be resolved to URL because it does not exist  {code}    This can be solved by using a file:// prefix    Maybe just update the docs?  
R867. hdfsjdbc throws an exception:  {code}  org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanDefinitionStoreException: Invalid bean definition with name 'itemReader' defined in URL [file:/Users/trisberg/Projects/spring-xd/build/dist/spring-xd/xd/modules/job/hdfsjdbc/config/hdfsjdbc.xml]: Could not resolve placeholder 'columns' in string value "${columns}"  {code}    The hdfsjdbc job uses 'columns' instead of 'names' as the parameter for the column-names. Should we make this usage consistent between jobs?    There is a comment in the docs - "there is also a limitation in that the database table must be created manually. This is due to a bug in Spring Hadoop and will be fixed in the future." Think this is this solved in Spring Hadoop now?    initializeDatabase should default to false now to be consistent with jdbc sink    Rename batch-jdbc/mongo-import.properties to batch-jdbc/mongo.properties since these aren't just for import
R868. xd-shell is using the default spring-shell help command.  Need to create a help command specific to XD so that it can list the --hadoopDistro command line option.  Note, the hadoopDistro command line option is actually processed by the xd-shell bash script
R869. Use containsKey when checking for Parameters Add tests
R870. We should use fileName, fileExtension properties and default to /xd/jobname as directory
R871. The filejdbc jobs isn't included in the test scripts
R872. For some reason, the partitioned batch jobs are storing  {{StepExecutions}}s in the DB with a null ID.  This causes {{JobCommandTests.testListStepExecutionsForSpecificJobExecution()}} to fail because the HATEOS code asserts not null...  {code} 18:25:26,185 ERROR http-nio-9393-exec-3 rest.RestControllerAdvice:186 - Caught exception while handling a request java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: [Assertion failed] - this argument is required; it must not be null   org.springframework.util.Assert.notNull(Assert.java:112)   org.springframework.util.Assert.notNull(Assert.java:123)   org.springframework.hateoas.mvc.ResourceAssemblerSupport.createResourceWithId(ResourceAssemblerSupport.java:87)   org.springframework.xd.dirt.rest.StepExecutionInfoResourceAssembler.toResource(StepExecutionInfoResourceAssembler.java:39)   org.springframework.xd.dirt.rest.BatchStepExecutionsController.list(BatchStepExecutionsController.java:107) {code}  For some reason, the query for objects with the {{jobExecutionId}} also returned these two objects with null keys.  Blowing away my data directory fixes the problem (until I run another partitioned batch job).  I need to figure out why spring batch is creating these bad records, but we should probably add some defensive code to protect against null IDs.  You can reproduce by building against my XD-1146 branch. 
R873. This was added in bash scripts as part of XD-1186.
R874. Currently the shell assumes that the 'makeUnique'job parameter is by default *false*. That is not true. As a consequence the parameter has currently no impact/does not work.
R875. batchHashtagCount and batchWordCount  projects need "hadoop fs ls" instructions need to be updated.  
R876. Some boot classes we compile against have changed or been replaced.
R877. Using JSR303 groups, which should be derived from injected values
R878. The job names used by the tests should be unique across the tests when use the same JobRepository.    
R879. In distributed batch processing in XD, the JobLocator implementation for getJob(String jobName) should return a valid Job (FlowJob/SimpleJob).    Since we won't we relying on the MapJobRegistry's joblocator implementation which doesn't work in distributed use case, we need to have an appropriate way to return FlowJob/SimpleJob using XD's BatchJobLocator.
R880. Currently twitterstream emits native twitter json whereas twittersearch uses SI/Spring Social and emits spring social Tweet types. This makes it difficult to replace twitter sources and reuse XD stream definitions.  This requires coordination with SS 1.1.0 and SI 4.0 GA releases. NOTE: I think it's a good idea to continue to support native twitter JSON, keep as an option for twitterstream, but the default should be Tweet types.
R881. Server startup is done using Spring  Boot as well as starting a module application context at runtime.
R882. Batch jobs should use application.yml provided connection as default. They now have their own configuration in batch-jdbc.properties. This config needs to account for any changes made to application.yml settings so the data is written to the batch metadata database by default.
R883. Currently, the 'modules' project is marked as java project to enable eclipse/idea metadata files generation. But it generates a 'build' directory with a jar that has empty MANIFEST file.    This build directory also gets copied into the bundle after 'dist'.
R884. The MBeanServer is referred by XD admin/launcher when JMX is enabled (by setting --jmxEnabled option) and this is defined in xd-global-beans.xml.    The MBeans that are exposed by the modules also use the same MBeanServer define above and there is a duplicate MBeanServer definition (from jmx/common.xml) which the MBeanExportingPlugin adds as a component to the module which doesn't seem to be needed.    Also, currently the flag "jmxEnabled" is generic and used by adminserver/launcher as well as the module MBeanExportingPlugin. If we have a separate flag to enable the JMX *only* for modules then, a separate definition of MBeanServer could be necessary.  
R885. Currently, there are test data(e.g: stream name) not being cleaned up during teardown especially when there is a test case failure. This breaks the test suite when the same test data is used by other tests.    We need to move the cleanup logic at an appropriate level so that the test data is always cleaned up irrespective of the test result.
R886. Build should be able to generate code coverage reports.    After a quick tour of the intertubes it seems that JaCoCo is a well maintained project and has first class support inside gradle.    http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html  
R887. Not sure if this is best done via Sonar our sonar build plan, the nightly one, or the frequent one off master...    Open question is if we want to fail a build do to code coverage levels.
R888. https://sonar.springsource.org/dashboard/index/7173?did=3    Shows which of our current tests take the most time to execute.    xd.dirt.stream and xd.shell.command are where the most time is spent.    In xd.dirt.stream it seems likely that time can be reduced by not restarting a new single node server per test, but sharing it across tests, e.g.     RabbitSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests 	   LocalSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests   RedisSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests 	    As a first pass, the test that take longer than 15 seconds in that report should be investigated.  
R889. AbstractSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests is the basis of 'state of the art' testing for a stream that allows you to get a reference to the input and output channel of the stream    http | filter | transform | file.    One can send messages to the channel after the http module, but before filter and one can retrieve the messages that were sent to the channel after the transform module but before file.    The current implementation inside AbstractSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests can be improved in terms of ease of use for end-users.      The issue is to create as simple a way as possible for a user to test their processing modules/stream definitions without having to actually do a real integration test by sending data to the input module.    Either as a separate issue or as part of this one, the documentation     https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Creating-a-Processor-Module    should be updated to explicitly show how to use this issue's test functionality.  
R890. Create a project that includes build and test automation for a new Angular based UI.  This work is independent of calling the UI build step from gradle.  A super minimal UI, just to have some basic code, is all that is required.     This should use     Grunt  Jasmine  Karma  Bower  YUIdoc (separate story?)    UI Components from backbone should be available in the base project.    
R891. Blog post http://naleid.com/blog/2013/01/24/calling-gruntjs-tasks-from-gradle/  seems to be the definitive reference....
R892. This functionality should be added as a command line option to the main app in the spring-xd-ec2 project
R893. Add a stage to the plan that will stop any instances that the CI process may have started before and relaunch a 2 node install based on rabbit.    https://build.springsource.org/browse/XD-ATEC2 was created as an empty shell.    The running of across different transports will be handled in a separate story along with adding a stage to run a 'hello world' acceptance test.    
R894. Run test application developed in XD-1245    
R895. See https://quickstart.atlassian.com/download/bamboo/get-started/bamboo-elements    "Stages are comprised of one or more Jobs, which run in parallel"    we would like the tests across the rabbit and redis transport to occur in parallel.  
R896. See https://quickstart.atlassian.com/download/bamboo/get-started/bamboo-elements    "Stages are comprised of one or more Jobs, which run in parallel"    we would like the tests across the rabbit and redis transport to occur in parallel.
R897. The deployment of nodes is sequential, we can reduce the time to deploy a cluster greatly by having these tasks execute in parallel.
R898. Application will shutdown all servers with a specific name.    Application will take a --cluster-name parameter.     Generate artifact to state success or failure  
R899. * Use the cleanup app from XD-1243 to stop previous CI runs of XD on EC2.  * Build XD-EC2 deployer from github.  * Use XD-EC2 Deployer to deploy the CI XD-Instance  * Should produce artifact that contains the URL      * admin server of the XD cluster.     * container servers of the XD cluster
R900. Create a first pass at an acceptance test app for a stream definition of http | log.      This will involve creating two new projects in xd    1. spring-xd-integration-test  2. spring-xd-acceptance-tests    #1 will contain generally useful utility methods for acceptance test, such as sending data over http, obtaining and asserting JMX values of specific modules.  #2 will contain tests that use #1 to test the various out of the box modules provides in XD.
R901. In line with what we address at https://jira.springsource.org/browse/XD-1223, there are cases where tests fail when there is an existing instance of hsqldb running.    Since hsqldb uses the same port and database, it causes issues.
R902. These are duplicates of *SingleNodeDeploymentIntegrationTests
R903. We do not need two base classes for this
R904. e.g., make application static and check for initialization. Need to ensure each test restores the initial state of the server
R905. This test is very slow (2x the Redis version). Lots of stacktraces when running. Could be related. 
R906. See also XD-451 as reference.
R907. Currently, if we want to bind values to script variables we need to put them in a properties file like so:  xd:> stream create --name groovyprocessortest --definition "http --port=9006 | script --location=custom-processor.groovy --properties-location=custom-processor.properties | log  Ideally it should be:  xd:> stream create --name groovyprocessortest --definition "http --port=9006 | script --location=custom-processor.groovy --foo=bar --baz=boo | log   
R908. I see the topics/exchanges created for Redis/Rabbit message buses have the prefix "topic." Is there any reason why we didn't have the prefix "queue." for the name of the queue created in Rabbit message bus in compared with the queue created in Redis message bus which has prefix "queue."  
R909. XD singlenode currenly initialized in @Before, should be @BeforeClass. In this case must be re-initialized for each transport, but not for each @Test.
R910. The modules are exposed via JMX and in turn exposed over http via jolokia.  See https://jira.springsource.org/browse/XD-343.  This issue is to develop a helper method that given a stream id and/or module name, assert that the number of messages processed after sending stimulus messages is as expected. e.g.  int originalCount = getCount("testStream", "file");  //do stuff that generates 100 messages assertCount("testStream", "file", 100, originalCount)  For now we can assume we know the location of where the modules are located by assuming we have only one container deployed.
R911. It is useful to configure operating system so that it will start Spring XD automatically on boot.    For example, in Linux it would be great if Spring XD distro contains init.d script to run it as service. A typical init.d script gets executed with arguments such as "start", "stop", "restart", "pause", etc. In order for an init.d script to be started or stopped by init during startup and shutdown, the script needs to handle at least "start" and "stop" arguments.  
R912. The logic can be found in DefaultModuleOptionsMetadataCollector but caused problems in the initial PR. Revisit if needed
R913. Currently the message bus is only obtained via Module.getComponent(MessageBus.class). Stream testing scenarios that depend on sending and receiving payloads via named channels do not require a deployed module instance per se, but any stream flow control uses the MessageBus directly. Getting a deployed module instance in general is expensive, e.g., you have to wait for the module to deploy asynchronously, whereas the MessageBus implementation could be known a priori when the application starts. An improvement would be to ask the container for its MessageBus.
R914. The Rabbit endpoint suffers from a problem similar to XD-1067.  Seems like spring-[rabbit/amqp] needs to be bumped to 1.3.0.M1 to fix it.  Sadly, we get this error:  noformat  java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.springframework.amqp.core.MessageProperties.getContentLength()J  at org.springframework.integration.amqp.support.DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper.extractStandardHeaders(DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper.java:102)  at org.springframework.integration.amqp.support.DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper.extractStandardHeaders(DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper.java:53)  at org.springframework.integration.mapping.AbstractHeaderMapper.toHeaders(AbstractHeaderMapper.java:205)  at org.springframework.integration.mapping.AbstractHeaderMapper.toHeadersFromRequest(AbstractHeaderMapper.java:148)  at org.springframework.integration.amqp.inbound.AmqpInboundChannelAdapter$1.onMessage(AmqpInboundChannelAdapter.java:75)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer.doInvokeListener(AbstractMessageListenerContainer.java:584)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer.invokeListener(AbstractMessageListenerContainer.java:482)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.SimpleMessageListenerContainer.access$001(SimpleMessageListenerContainer.java:69)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.SimpleMessageListenerContainer$1.invokeListener(SimpleMessageListenerContainer.java:144)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.SimpleMessageListenerContainer.invokeListener(SimpleMessageListenerContainer.java:920)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer.executeListener(AbstractMessageListenerContainer.java:454)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.SimpleMessageListenerContainer.doReceiveAndExecute(SimpleMessageListenerContainer.java:728)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.SimpleMessageListenerContainer.receiveAndExecute(SimpleMessageListenerContainer.java:712)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.SimpleMessageListenerContainer.access$400(SimpleMessageListenerContainer.java:69)  at org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.SimpleMessageListenerContainer$AsyncMessageProcessingConsumer.run(SimpleMessageListenerContainer.java:812)  at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:724)  noformat  Updating to latest SI snapshot does not help (as of Jan 23rd)
R915. In trying to upgrade to latest SI, I encountered a failing test because it expects an error message to contain something, but SI changes make it disappear (the problem is an SI exception now has an explicit message and so does not expose its cause message anymore)  This, however is the manifest of a deeper "problem". We currently expose the getMessage() of any generic Exception caught, in the VndError REST construct. But this is not enough.  Things that we can consider are: 1) adding the whole stacktrace of the caught exception, as a String. This is not very good at it leaks java specific details 2) unwrap the caught exception to get to the deepest cause. This may not be what we want everytime 3) construct a VndErrors (note the 's') made of each layered exception 4) similar to 1), but not using the stacktrace, only the messages of each cause  etc 
R916. There are explicit Thread.sleep() calls after deploy() in some of the test methods in  AbstractSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests.  Also, the test method deployAndUndeploy() doesn't have explicit Thread.sleep() and fails inconsistently with this error:  java.lang.AssertionError: stream test0 not undeployed    org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)   org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41)   org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.AbstractSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests.waitForUndeploy(AbstractSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests.java:332)   org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.AbstractSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests.deployAndUndeploy(AbstractSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests.java:221)   sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)   sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57)   sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)   java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:601)   org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:47)   org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:12)   org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:44)   org.junit.internal.runners.statements.InvokeMethod.evaluate(InvokeMethod.java:17)   org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunAfters.evaluate(RunAfters.java:27)   org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runLeaf(ParentRunner.java:271)   org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:70)   org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:50)   org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.run(ParentRunner.java:238)   org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.schedule(ParentRunner.java:63)   org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:236)   org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:53)   org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$2.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:229)   org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:26)   org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunAfters.evaluate(RunAfters.java:27)   org.springframework.xd.test.AbstractExternalResourceTestSupport$1.evaluate(AbstractExternalResourceTestSupport.java:71)   org.junit.rules.ExternalResource$1.evaluate(ExternalResource.java:48)   org.junit.rules.ExternalResource$1.evaluate(ExternalResource.java:48)   org.junit.rules.RunRules.evaluate(RunRules.java:20)   org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:309)   org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.testing.junit.JUnitTestClassExecuter.runTestClass(JUnitTestClassExecuter.java:86)   org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.testing.junit.JUnitTestClassExecuter.execute(JUnitTestClassExecuter.java:49)   org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.testing.junit.JUnitTestClassProcessor.processTestClass(JUnitTestClassProcessor.java:69)   org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.testing.SuiteTestClassProcessor.processTestClass(SuiteTestClassProcessor.java:50)   sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)   sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57)   sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)   java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:601)   org.gradle.messaging.dispatch.ReflectionDispatch.dispatch(ReflectionDispatch.java:35)   org.gradle.messaging.dispatch.ReflectionDispatch.dispatch(ReflectionDispatch.java:24)   org.gradle.messaging.dispatch.ContextClassLoaderDispatch.dispatch(ContextClassLoaderDispatch.java:32)   org.gradle.messaging.dispatch.ProxyDispatchAdapter$DispatchingInvocationHandler.invoke(ProxyDispatchAdapter.java:93)   com.sun.proxy.$Proxy2.processTestClass(Unknown Source)   org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.testing.worker.TestWorker.processTestClass(TestWorker.java:103)   sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)   sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57)   sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)   java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:601)   org.gradle.messaging.dispatch.ReflectionDispatch.dispatch(ReflectionDispatch.java:35)   org.gradle.messaging.dispatch.ReflectionDispatch.dispatch(ReflectionDispatch.java:24)   org.gradle.messaging.remote.internal.hub.MessageHub$Handler.run(MessageHub.java:355)   org.gradle.internal.concurrent.DefaultExecutorFactory$StoppableExecutorImpl$1.run(DefaultExecutorFactory.java:64)   java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)   java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)   java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)
R917. Improve how the state of the stream is managed.    A deploy command moves the stream from the undeployed state to the deploying state. If all modules in the stream are successfully deployed, the stream state is ‘deployed’ If one or more module deployments failed, the stream state is failed.  Any modules that were successfully deployed, are still running.      Sending an undeploy command will stop all modules of the stream and return the stream to the undeployed state.    For the individual modules that failed, we will be able to find out which ones failed.  Not yet sure if we can try to redeploy just those parts of the stream that failed.    See the [design doc|https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/1kWtoH_xEF1wMklzQ8AZaiuhBZWIlpCDi8G9_hAP8Fgc/edit#heading=h.2rk74f16ow4i] for more details.    Story points for this issue are the total of all the story points for the subtasks.
R918. Currently, few of the boot's actuator endpoints go missing in the EndpointHandler mapping.  They are: BeansEndpoint, dumpEndpoint, traceEndpoint, healthEndpoint, infoEndpoint.    Also, the EndpointHandler mapping doesn't even happen in case of LauncherApplication.  I think this is because the LauncherApplication context starts with port '0' and the TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer sets the local port for it later. With port '0', the Endpointhandler mapping is disabled during the EndpointHandler mapping bean creation.
R919. Since makeUnique, dateFormat and numberFormat now have their own module options now, they are nicely advertised as options to a job (and will benefit from code completion soon), so they can be removed from the shell (where they currently allow for a misconfiguration if set at both the job and shell level)
R920. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Taps mentions this but the explanation needs more elaboration and example, e.g.   mystream ->   "http | flibble: transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | file"    "tap:stream:mystream.flibble > transform --expression=payload.replaceAll('A','.') | log");
R921. To show best practice, our batch jobs should include these listeners so that notifications can be sent.  In particular it is desirable that jobs with file item readers can send the files that were processed so another stream can be sent the file name when the job completes to move/delete the file
R922. May want to fix "properly" when tackling the module options for composed modules, but this is currently broken (and wasn't at some point):    module compose upperHttp --definition "http | transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase()"  stream create foo --definition "upperHttp | log"    This will fail saying that ${port} can't be resolved    This will work though:  module compose upperHttp --definition "http --port=9000 | transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase()"  stream create foo --definition "upperHttp | log"      Note that   stream create foo --definition "upperHttp --port=xxx | log" should work too wut won't, but that's another bug (will create after this one)
R923. The kite SDK is used to write Avro records in a Kite specific format and also it support the parquet format for which we will eventually support.
R924. I cannot access the JMX/Jolokia endpoints using the Spring Boot RC1 and Snapshot.  Works with XD-M5 and Boot-M7
R925. Create a better UI instead of Boot's default "Whitelabel Error Page"
R926. Will likely involve having the module identity (type+name) be part of the OptionsMetadata identity/cache key
R927. This is about computing the value to support expressions such as ${xd.stream.name} as a default.  Initial discussion suggested to leverage the work done in XD-1175 by having a custom @LateValue (or @DeployTimeValue, etc) be resolved at deployment time
R928. When doing dsl completion in a stream definition and a module option accepts a value that has a closed set of possible values (eg booleans, enums), we can provide completions for those.  
R929. see CompletionProviderTests#testUnfinishedModuleNameShouldReturnCompletions()    Ideally, would require a change in the parser so that it knows which kind of module was expected when it failed.
R930. see discussion at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/495#discussion-diff-9291037
R931. xd:>stream create --name simple --definition "http | transform | filter | transform | file" Created new stream 'simple' xd:>stream create --name tapSimple --definition "tap:stream:mystream.transform > file" Created new stream 'tapSimple'  There isn't a stream named "mystream"... I don't remember if we want to allow for this (set up taps before there is a stream) or if it should be an error.  Otherwise, works as expected  xd:>stream create --name tapSimple2 --definition "tap:stream:simple.transform > file" Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: XD144E:(pos 11): Reference to 'transform' is not unique in the target stream 'http | transform | filter | transform | file', please label the relevant module and use the label, or use a suffix index to indicate which occurrence of the module, e.g. 'transform.0' tap:simple.transform
R932. Need a way to tell the user that this option will be determined at runtime,late bindings.  In the module info command, references to ${xd.stream.name} could read "<use stream name>" for example)
R933. The current configuration prevents modules to have default values that evaluate to null.  The workaround is to either:    - have the module have its own PPC (which allows nulls)  - rid the placeholders with ${foo:}
R934. Currently, ModuleDeployer is a disposable bean. When the container context is closed, the ModuleDeployer bean is destroyed along with its associated common context and deployed modules. Issue arises, if the connectionfactory bean associated with the deployed modules' message bus bindings  is destroyed before the ModuleDeployer bean, there is exception stacktrace (at least in case of Redis MessageBus) saying "Connection closed".     Adding SmartLifecycle support to ModuleDeployer will make sure all the beans are destroyed during Lifecycle processor's stop() method before any of the singletonbeans are destroyed.    The stacktrace (when using Redis MessageBus is):    org.springframework.data.redis.RedisSystemException: Redis exception; nested exception is com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisException: Connection closed  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceExceptionConverter.convert(LettuceExceptionConverter.java:45)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceExceptionConverter.convert(LettuceExceptionConverter.java:35)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceConverters.toDataAccessException(LettuceConverters.java:158)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceConnection.convertLettuceAccessException(LettuceConnection.java:237)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceConnection.bRPop(LettuceConnection.java:1449)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.DefaultListOperations$12.inRedis(DefaultListOperations.java:154)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.AbstractOperations$ValueDeserializingRedisCallback.doInRedis(AbstractOperations.java:50)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisTemplate.execute(RedisTemplate.java:181)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.RedisTemplate.execute(RedisTemplate.java:149)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.AbstractOperations.execute(AbstractOperations.java:84)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.DefaultListOperations.rightPop(DefaultListOperations.java:151)  at org.springframework.data.redis.core.DefaultBoundListOperations.rightPop(DefaultBoundListOperations.java:92)  at org.springframework.integration.redis.inbound.RedisQueueMessageDrivenEndpoint.popMessageAndSend(RedisQueueMessageDrivenEndpoint.java:178)  at org.springframework.integration.redis.inbound.RedisQueueMessageDrivenEndpoint.access$300(RedisQueueMessageDrivenEndpoint.java:51)  at org.springframework.integration.redis.inbound.RedisQueueMessageDrivenEndpoint$ListenerTask.run(RedisQueueMessageDrivenEndpoint.java:291)  at org.springframework.integration.util.ErrorHandlingTaskExecutor$1.run(ErrorHandlingTaskExecutor.java:52)  at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)  Caused by: com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisException: Connection closed  at com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisAsyncConnection.await(RedisAsyncConnection.java:1079)  at com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisConnection.await(RedisConnection.java:820)  at com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisConnection.brpop(RedisConnection.java:101)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceConnection.bRPop(LettuceConnection.java:1447)  ... 12 more  13:19:00,897 WARN Thread-5 support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor:257 - Failed to stop bean 'org.springframework.integration.redis.inbound.RedisInboundChannelAdapter#0'  com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisException: Connection is closed  at com.lambdaworks.redis.RedisAsyncConnection.dispatch(RedisAsyncConnection.java:1065)  at com.lambdaworks.redis.pubsub.RedisPubSubConnection.unsubscribe(RedisPubSubConnection.java:82)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceSubscription.doUnsubscribe(LettuceSubscription.java:68)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.util.AbstractSubscription.unsubscribe(AbstractSubscription.java:186)  at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.util.AbstractSubscription.unsubscribe(AbstractSubscription.java:146)  at org.springframework.data.redis.listener.RedisMessageListenerContainer$SubscriptionTask.cancel(RedisMessageListenerContainer.java:836)  at org.springframework.data.redis.listener.RedisMessageListenerContainer.stop(RedisMessageListenerContainer.java:210)  at org.springframework.integration.redis.inbound.RedisInboundChannelAdapter.doStop(RedisInboundChannelAdapter.java:127)  at org.springframework.integration.endpoint.AbstractEndpoint.stop(AbstractEndpoint.java:100)  at org.springframework.integration.endpoint.AbstractEndpoint.stop(AbstractEndpoint.java:115)  at org.springframework.context.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor.doStop(DefaultLifecycleProcessor.java:229)  at org.springframework.context.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor.access$300(DefaultLifecycleProcessor.java:51)  at org.springframework.context.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor$LifecycleGroup.stop(DefaultLifecycleProcessor.java:363)  at org.springframework.context.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor.stopBeans(DefaultLifecycleProcessor.java:202)  at org.springframework.context.support.DefaultLifecycleProcessor.onClose(DefaultLifecycleProcessor.java:118)  at org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext.doClose(AbstractApplicationContext.java:888)  at org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.EmbeddedWebApplicationContext.doClose(EmbeddedWebApplicationContext.java:157)  at org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext$1.run(AbstractApplicationContext.java:809)
R935. There is no point in providing completion with something that will fail when the user tries it. The information about a module being a composed is now available at the REST layer, so should be used
R936. Currently, the job module's batch job's bean id should be "job". This also causes the job name to be 'actual-job-name + ".job"' and the batch job controllers require to search for job with suffix ".job".     Removing this constraint would help us avoiding these.
R937. Currently, the reactorEnv bean is defined in module-common context and the spring-xd-dirt has the runtime dependency over spring-xd-extension-reactor project.     This enables boot's ReactorAutoConfiguration to initialize the reactor environment, we have the reactor setup configured for both admin and container server applications.    Since reactor environment is not being used by container and only used by the reactor-syslog module, we can move the reactorEnv bean definition in reactor-syslog module.    There is one caveat in this approach as the reactor environment gets setup everytime a new reactor-syslog module is deployed.
R938. If JMX is enabled for modules (enabling the IntegrationMBeanExporter), the ModuleTypeConversionPlugin fails to get the reference to input/output channel (for adding the ContentTypeHeaderInterceptor) and results in exception.    It seems like the IntegrationMBeanExporter (when JMX is enabled) creates JdkDynamicAopProxy for all the integration components and thereby the following check on ModuleTypeConversionPlugin to retrieve the AbstractMessageChannel fails.    AbstractMessageChannel channel = null;  			if (isInput) {  				channel = module.getComponent("input", AbstractMessageChannel.class);  			}  			else {  				channel = module.getComponent("output", AbstractMessageChannel.class);  			}    I see the reason why AbstractMessageChannel is used here (to use some of the methods in the implementing class that didn't exist in the interfaces) but IntegrationMBeanExporter creating JdkDynamicAopProxy for the channel fails to resolve as AbstractMessageChannel here.    Following is the full stack trace:    To replicate,    stream create testing --definition ""http --outputType=text/plain | log"  3:45,238 ERROR redisInboundAdapter-redis:queue-inbound-channel-adapter1

R939. If JMX is enabled, some of the integration tests fail.    This is similar to what we see in XD-1295.    One example of this case is, the test classes that extend StreamTestSupport.    In StreamTestSupport, the @BeforeClass has this line:    moduleDeployer = containerContext.getBean(ModuleDeployer.class);    When JMX is enable, the IntegrationMBeanExporter creates JdkDynamicProxy for the ModuleDeployer (since it is of type MessageHandler) and thereby the above line to get bean by the implementing class type (ModuleDeployer) fails.    There are few other places where we use to refer the implementing classes on getBean().  Looks like we need to fix those as well.    
R940. Commit 96de9fcfaf32719413015a1a6bace1b30b6b9610 strengthened module type inference, but some corner cases remain (marked as TODOs and commented out assertions in tests).    To be effective, we need to look at the whole deployed stream (or composed module). Modify ParsinContext accordingly.
R941. Most likely due to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-shell/commit/296e4d2ff0e6e91d91209ab8717335357c587de0  When the user submits with ENTER, the shell appears to hang
R942. Currently, the fileDeletion listeners are added to filepollhdfs and filejdbc OOTB job modules so that the files are deleted after successful completion of jobs that write the file into hdfs/jdbc.    We have "--deleteFiles" option in ResourcesIntoJdbcJobModuleOptionsMetadata (from https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/562)  which makes it available for hdfsjdbc job module as well. But it is not supported yet as it involves deletion of HDFS files.    We need the file deletion listeners for the hdfsjdbc and hdfsmongodb job modules so that if opted to delete files, it can be supported.    
R943. There are few boolean type module option properties whose default values are specified in the module definitions than their corresponding ModuleOptionsMetaData.     Also, when using boolean we need to have module option using primitive type boolean than Boolean type.    Currently, these are some of the module options that require this change:    "initializeDatabase" in modules filejdbc, hdfsjdbc job modules, aggregator processor module, jdbc sink module    "restartable" in all the job modules    "deleteFiles" in filejdbc, filepollhdfs job modules              
R944. Problem: The container that the stream was deployed to, will not allow new streams to be deployed.  Once the error occurs, the only solution is to terminate the XD Container and restart it.  To reproduce create a stream foo and destroy the stream, then create the stream  foo again.  This best done programmatically, taking the same steps using the "shell" may not reproduce the problem.  i.e. if you put a Sleep of 1-2 seconds between the destroy and the next create, it works fine  
R945. currently the file sink only supports append.  User should support an overwrite feature.
R946. Commit https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/commit/761cd5e8250c055878caf3a789ab5b3254ba48e8 introduced support for FTP and added a bunch of .x classes.    These should not belong to DIRT proper though, and should be added to an extension style project. The job(s) module would then depend on them
R947. HATEOAS 0.9 introduced some support for templated links. This should be leveraged to properly handle eg /streams/{id} instead of using string concatenation
R948. When trying some of the examples of XD-159, came up with weird behavior of the transform module.    This boils down to:  {noformat}  stream create foo --definition "http |transform --expression='new java.lang.Integer(payload)' |  transform --expression=payload.getClass() | log"  http post --data 42   ==> Integer (OK)  http post --data WTH => WTH (!)  {noformat}    Seems that when the expression can not be evaluated, the incoming payload is transmitted as is
R949. When using a JSR303 annotated class for module options, the binding failures should be bypassed, as they interfere with completion proposals.  
R950. Disregard the missing date that is caused by another problem.  Here is the setup:  {noformat}  xd:>job execution list    Id  Job Name  Start Time                        Step Execution Count  Status    --  --------  --------------------------------  --------------------  ---------    13  foo         Europe/Paris                    0                     STARTING    12  foo       2014-02-12 15:39:46 Europe/Paris  1                     FAILED    11  foo       2014-02-12 15:39:29 Europe/Paris  1                     COMPLETED    10  foo       2014-02-12 15:38:36 Europe/Paris  1                     COMPLETED    9   foo       2014-02-12 15:38:21 Europe/Paris  1                     COMPLETED    8   foo         Europe/Paris                    0                     STARTING    7   foo       2014-02-12 15:25:41 Europe/Paris  1                     COMPLETED    6   foo       2014-02-12 15:25:04 Europe/Paris  1                     FAILED    5   foo       2014-02-12 15:14:32 Europe/Paris  1                     FAILED    4   foo       2014-02-12 15:14:13 Europe/Paris  1                     FAILED    3   foo       2014-02-12 15:13:54 Europe/Paris  1                     FAILED    2   foo       2014-02-12 15:13:18 Europe/Paris  1                     FAILED    1   foo       2014-02-12 15:12:58 Europe/Paris  1                     FAILED    0   foo       2014-02-12 15:11:44 Europe/Paris  1                     FAILED    xd:>job execution restart --id 12  Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Job Execution 12 is already running.  {noformat}    while the server exception is a bit better:  {noformat}  Caused by: org.springframework.batch.core.repository.JobExecutionAlreadyRunningException: A job execution for this job is already running: JobInstance: id=11, version=0, Job=[foo]    org.springframework.batch.core.repository.support.SimpleJobRepository.createJobExecution(SimpleJobRepository.java:120)  {noformat}    I'd argue we should not speak in terms of execution ids if possible, but rather in terms of job names

R957. A lot of modules have similar options. Moreover, job modules often have options that belong to at least two domains (eg jdbc + hdfs).  I think that by using FlattenedCompositeModuleOptionsMetadata, we could come up with a way to combine several options POJOs into one. Something like:  public class JdbcHdfsOptionsMetadata {    @OptionsMixin   private JdbcOptionsMetadata jdbc;    @OptionsMixin   private HdfsOptionsMetadata hdfs; }  this would expose eg "driverClass" as well as "rolloverSize" as top level options. Values could be actually injected into the fields, so that eg custom validation could occur (default validation for the mixin class would occur by default)
R958. Add YARN specific code based on Janne's prototyping    Add YARN Client and AppMaster implementations and startup config files    This includes shell scripts to deploy XD to YARN    Test working on Apache 2.2 distribution    We can modify config files, everything should be possible to override by providing command-line args or env variables.  ./xd-yarn-deploy --zipFile /tmp/spring-xd-yarn.zip --config /tmp/spring-xd-yarn.yml    
R959. There seems to be some intersection with the work for this issue and the rationalization of how module properties are handled.  There will be changes to configuration/property management support such that each module (source, sink, etc) will be able to also be overridden in spring-xd.yml (or wherever -Dspring.config.location points to.  The HDFS sink module for example, will have default values based on it's OptionsMetadata and will be of the form <type>.<module>.<option>      That means in the configuration for hdfs.xml sink, there would be a config section such as    {code:xml}      <configuration>        fs.default.name=${sink.hdfs.hd.fs}        mapred.job.tracker=${sink.hdfs.hd.jt}        yarn.resourcemanager.address=${sink.hdfs.hd.rm}        mapreduce.framework.name=${sink.hdfs.mr.fw}      </configuration>  {code}    With default values defined by a HdfsSinkOptionsMetadata class.  The hdfs.xml module file would not contain any references to a properties file.    A file specified by -Dspring.config.location could override the values in a config section such as    sink:    hdfs:      hd.fs : hdfs://foobarhost:8020      hd.jt : 10.123.123.123:9000    etc.

R967. While the current setting work while running from your laptop to local deployments.  Or running from your laptop to ec2, they are not long enough for CI to Ec2. This should have good defaults and have CI set them to what it needs.
R968. The external configuration fragment file support by setting spring.config.location in the XD startup scripts are not updated in xd-admin, xd-container and xd-singlenode .bat scripts.   Please refer: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/582 
R969. Currently samples use separate build scripts, so the XD versions, etc. may all be different. There should be a top level build script or at least a way to ensure the same version dependencies
R970. When importing XD as a gradle project into STS, it fails with    Missing directories spring-xd-hadoop/hdp20 and spring-xd-yarn    mkdir on these directories solves the problem.    The hdp20 case relates to XD-599 - it is not clear why spring-xd-yarn is needed.  
R971. If a third party messaging solution wants to be the transport layer in SpringXD they must currently fork the SpringXD code base and change the enums.  Example: CommonDistributedOptions.ControlTransport currently limits to the following options (rabbit, redis).  So if a third party like messaging system, like ZeroMQ, wanted to plug-in they would have to add to the enum.  Here is another example where GemFire was used as the messaging system:   https://github.com/charliemblack/spring-xd/blob/master/spring-xd-dirt/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/dirt/server/options/CommonDistributedOptions.java#L38  All messaging enums should be removed for an extensible model.
R972. In a running system some times the algorithm for partitioning the data might overload a given server with work.  When that happens we might need to "rebalance" the partitioned work / data to achieve a even balance of stream throughput across servers in a given compute group.  We can think of this dynamic rebalancing behavior as an extension of a failure use case.   In the failure scenario we need to re-partition the stream to other servers in the group.  We should allow third parties to plug-in to help with this capability.  As an example GemFire will report the new partitioning meta-data when this type failure / rebalance happens. 
R973. We need a methodology for providing partitioning hints.    A current proposal uses message headers to provide:    * partition_key – the item to partition on  * destination_region – what to target    In the proposal the developer used "partition_key" to route the stream message to the node where data was stored in process.  This was done so downstream stream operations could work on the data with out suffering any network IO.    The "destination_region" was used to target the type of data the downstream streams were going to use in their stream processing.      
R974. Need some kind of hint that a given deployment is to be run on a group of servers.  That deployment would then be part of a partitioned work flow.    Another item on this would be the "group" that the server is running in can be added to removed dynamically.  The use case on this would be if the group of servers are running a max CPU capacity we can easily add another compute node.  Likewise we can remove a server from the group if the servers are not being fully utilized.       This issue is lightly linked to:  https://jira.springsource.org/browse/XD-1337
R975. Currently, the XD container uses embedded tomcat only to support management server that acts as the RESTful server for boot's actuator MVC and jolokia endpoints.    If the configuration is set to use a specific management port (using the fixes addressed via XD-1122), then we don't need to have embedded tomcat servlet container in XD container. 
R976. Currently, hsqldb, postgres and mysql job repositories are supported. We need to add configurable oracle jdbc settings.
R977. By having the configuration option for concurrent consumers would help improve the performance of message consumption by the consumer modules when the ordering of the incoming messages don't matter.
R978. Provide an easy way for users to add beans (e.g., Gemfire cache configuration) or modify default XD configuration such as serializers, and message converters. A simple approach is to add a well known resource selector such as classpath*:META-INF/spring/xd/extensions or include this path in an extensible @Configuration base class.  In addition, we should adopt conventional names for beans that are meant to be extended, e.g. use an xd. prefix.

R980. Following merge of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/601, use dot as the separator for a composed module option.    Need change to the parser to accept dots
R981. Following merge of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/601, allow a module option to be known by several names and elect a short name in composed module options when there is no ambiguity
R982. Following merge of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/601, expose a unique id under which a module is known inside a stream. That id (which defaults to the module name) is what should be used as the qualifier for an option name inside a composed module, ie    {noformat}  module compose foo --definition "f1: filter | filter"    ==>  f1.expression and filter.expression are available  {noformat}
R983. This requires exposing properties to the ListenerContainer. Probably cleaner to inject the ListenerContainer into the RabbitMessageBus and expose property placeholders on the LC. Maybe do the same for RabbitAdmin as well. 
R984. We currently pull all hdfs config properties from hdfs.properties - change that to use application.yml
R985. The enum unnecessarily restricts the ability to add new transport (MessageBus implementations) whereas the config location path is open for extensions since it uses wildcards (in message-bus.xml):    {code}  <import resource="../../transports/${XD_TRANSPORT}-bus.xml"/>  {code}  
R986. This will allow us to control the order of plugins and use plugin(s) to manage the common module context, replacing BeanDefinitionAddingBeanPostProcesser
R987. While processing the "Job Launch" request, the ModuleDeployer checks if the job is already deployed, if not it deploys the job before launching it.  This approach causes issue in case of multiple containers environment where the job is deployed in one container(1) but the "job launch" request is picked up by other container(2). Because the container(2) that processes "job launch" request deploys the job again, it conflicts with an existing job that is deployed in conatiner(1) with the same name in the JobRepository.    Initially, the idea behind 'deploy before launch' was to enable launch shell command to also deploy. Because of the issue mentioned above, it is ok to assume that job launch needs to be performed on an existing deployed job.
R988. The Spring Data team recommends using the Jedis driver since the Lettuce driver hasn't had any update activity for several months. Jedis is actively maintained.    We might also want to investigate Redisson which is a fork of Lettuce - https://github.com/mrniko/redisson
R989. Post-boot refactoring. XDContainer lifecycle methods are not being used. Refactor by merging relevant functionality into LauncherApplication. Rename LauncherApplication to ContainerServerApplication (consistent with AdminServerApplication).  
R990. When the container shuts down, ContainerStoppedEvent should be published so that appropriate listeners would act on.  Please refer to this discussion here:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/612
R991. Starting the shell with --hadoopDistro hdp20 causes this:    Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.beans.factory.parsing.BeanDefinitionParsingException: Configuration problem: Unable to locate Spring NamespaceHandler for XML schema namespace [http://www.springframework.org/schema/hadoop]  Offending resource: URL [jar:file:/Users/trisberg/Demo/spring-xd-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/shell/lib/spring-xd-shell-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar!/META-INF/spring/spring-shell-plugin.xml]    Creating a stream "time | hdfs" in xd-singlenode started with --hadoopDistro hdp20 causes this:    java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't find class used for type of option 'codec': org.springframework.data.hadoop.store.codec.Codecs  
R992. The /xd/containers node is the parent where each Container will write an ephemeral child node. The node name should be the Container's ID, and the node data should be the Container's attributes (host, pid, and much more to be added later).    When a Container shuts down cleanly, it should eagerly delete the ephemeral node so that watchers are notified immediately. For any other case (including a network partition), the ephemeral node will disappear after the timeout elapses.
R993. These are no longer used post boot.  
R994. The Json information returned by curl does not reflect deployed status correctly.  To recreate:  1. Start xd-singlenode  2. start xd-shell  In the xd-shell      (i). stream create --definition "time | log" --name ticktock     (ii). stream list  Note the status of the ticktock stream is deployed  3. open a new command prompt & type curl http://localhost:9393/streams/ticktock  4. Note the returned json stream:    {"name":"ticktock","deployed":null,"definition":"time | log","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"http://localhost:9393/streams/ticktock"}]}  5. I would expect the json attribute "deployed" to be "true", but it is null.
R995. This will be used by SingleNodeApplication if no ZooKeeper process is available based on the provided client connect string. It will still be recommended that user's run ZooKeeper externally, at least in standalone mode, when running SingleNodeApplication. We should clarify that in the documentation and logs.    It should implement SmartLifecycle so that it can be managed as a bean within an ApplicationContext.
R996. I've installed spring xd for the first time today on my mac, using the homebrew distribution.

release manually from the zip file and setting up XD_HOME and my path as documented, so I guess it's a problem specific to the homebrew installation.
R997. Currently, the job notification channels are direct channels. We need to make these pub/sub channels.    With XD-885 (allowing automatic job listeners registration),  this would allow us to create named channel syntax like:    topic:job:myjobname-jobExecution > log  topic:job:myjobname-stepExecution > log     
R998. Currently, job module only has an input channel that receives the job launching requests. If we have an output channel for the job module, we get the following benefits:    1) The output channel reflects the JobExecution from the job launching message handler's reply channel  2) This can be different from JobExecution listener's notification channel where we would get both the beforeJob() and afterJob() notification.  3) We can tap the output channel to send the job results to some other sinks.    Along with this improvement, planning to do some more refactoring on the Plugins so that some of the common implementation methods are handled in the base class.  
R999. The YARN support in M6 changes most of the config properties, need to update XD to use new ones.
R1000. create a composed module, use it in a stream, delete ALL streams.  Try to delete the composed module => fails thinking that it's still used by the stream    
R1001. When destroying a stream that contains an http source, an exception is thrown.  Thus even though the stream is destroyed all resources are not released i.e. port 9000 is still in use.    NettyHttpInboundChannelAdapter is currently setup with child.tcpNoDelay set to true.  And when running on my system and on EC2 the http needs more time to release the port.    My recommendation is to set bootstrap.setOption("child.tcpNoDelay", false) instead of true. 
R1002. xd/lib includes jcl-over-slf4j so we don't need additional commons-logging jars in the modules or extensions:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/610
R1003. The main container context becomes the shared context for modules.

R1006. Suppose we have 3 environements of Spring XD : - Dev environment  - Test environment  - Prod environement (  Suppose whe develop the script bellow: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// stream1 = http | filter --expression=payload.contains('toto') | file --dir=/tmp/toto  stream2 = http | filter --expression=payload.contains('titi') | file --dir=/tmp/titi //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  When we need to deploy the script in Test and Prod environements , we must modify "dir" option of "file" sink. This is very easy when there is not a lot of options and when we have a small factory team. But in a big factory environment this will be problematic.   In order to industrialize deployment, it would be convenient to implement in DSL a directory interface API or something equivalent like below:  Suppose we call this directory interface XDDI ... like "XD Directory Interface" :-)  The script can be like that: ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// stream1 = http | filter --expression=payload.contains('toto') | file --dir=XDDI('totoKey')  stream2 = http | filter --expression=payload.contains('titi') | file --dir=XDDI('titiKey')  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  The XDDI keys are defined in a centralized directory interface (admin console or XDDI.properties)  The XDDI keys/values in Dev environment: ///////////////////////////////////// totoKey=/tmp/toto titiKey=/tmp/titi /////////////////////////////////////  The XDDI keys/values in Test environment: ////////////////////////////////////////// totoKey=/tartempion/toto titiKey=/petaouchnok/titi /////////////////////////////////////////  The XDDI keys/values in Prod environment: ///////////////////////////////////////////////////// totoKey=/vavoirlabasijysuis/toto titiKey=/vavoirlabasijysuis/titi /////////////////////////////////////////////////////  When the script is deployed in Test or Prod environement, if the script contain a key that is not defined in centralized directory, the deployment fail.   This will reduce errors risks in a big factory environnement (several hundred parameters and signifiant team turnover).

The XD shell crashes when the following command issued:    stream create test --definition "http | filter --expression=!payload.contains('test') | log"    It looks like the JLine ConsoleReader's expandEvents is set to true by default and this causes the issue:    Exception in thread "Spring Shell" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: !payload.contains('test') | log": event not found    jline.console.ConsoleReader.expandEvents(ConsoleReader.java:734)    jline.console.ConsoleReader.finishBuffer(ConsoleReader.java:604)    jline.console.ConsoleReader.accept(ConsoleReader.java:1912)    jline.console.ConsoleReader.readLine(ConsoleReader.java:2537)    jline.console.ConsoleReader.readLine(ConsoleReader.java:2162)    jline.console.ConsoleReader.readLine(ConsoleReader.java:2150)    org.springframework.shell.core.JLineShell.promptLoop(JLineShell.java:517)    org.springframework.shell.core.JLineShell.run(JLineShell.java:178)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)  
R1009. This applies to a few places (when addressing the issue, a search should be done to uncover any others), e.g.:    ContainerServerApplication:      public static final String NODE_PROFILE = "node";    *Options classes:       "The transport to use for data messages (from node to node)"       "The transport to use for control messages (between admin and nodes)"  
R1010. e.g. rabbit.xml source.    	<context:property-placeholder  location="${xd.config.home}/${configProperties:rabbit}.properties"  ignore-resource-not-found="true" />    would be removed and    	<rabbit:connection-factory id="rabbitConnectionFactory" host="${host:${spring.rabbitmq.host:localhost}}"  port="${port:${spring.rabbitmq.port:5672}}" virtual-host="${vhost:${spring.rabbitmq.virtualHost:/}}"  username="${username:${spring.rabbitmq.username:guest}}" password="${password:${spring.rabbitmq.password:guest}}"/>    would look like  port="${port}" and a property file in the module directory or POJO in the module lib would specify the default value of the port.    For POJO it would be  options_class = org.springframework.xd.dirt.modules.metadata.RabbitSourceOptionsMetadata    For property file it would be  option.port.default=5672  option.port.description="cool port number"    This needs to be consistently done across all the modules.              
R1011. When executing tests and failures occur (should be easy to simulate with a forced failure), several other side-effect failures occur with the following error:    {code}  Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: HSQLDB could not be started. Maybe another instance is already running on 0.0.0.0:13583 ?  {code}    It seems that the failing tests are not properly cleaning up, so the HSQLDB instance they started is still running thereby causing the other failures.    In the case I last witnessed this on a dev branch, I had a valid failure in LocalControlRedisDataInitializationTests (the environmentMatchesTransport method, specifically) and TypeConvertingStreamTests. So, perhaps a good way to start exploring this issue is to simulate a failure in one or both of those classes. The false negatives I'm seeing are in the following:    {code}  LocalSingleNodeInitializationTests.environmentMatchesTransport  RabbitSingleNodeInitializationTests.environmentMatchesTransport  RedisSingleNodeInitializationTests.environmentMatchesTransport  FileSourceModuleTests.classMethod  LocalSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests.classMethod  RabbitSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests.classMethod  RabbitSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests.classMethod  {code}    They all seem to be tests that start the SingleNodeApplication.
R1012. [Problem] Can't use tcp source, sink and http together on Single Node.  While creating tests for CI I tried to create the following: [Steps to Reproduce] xd:>stream create fooOut --definition "tcp|file" Created new stream 'fooOut' xd:>stream create fooIn --definition "http --port=9002|tcp" Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Failed to bind to: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:9000. Possibly the port is already in use. Even if I use different ports for the tcp I still get failures pointing to 9000. [Extra Notes] The stream below is works. xd:>stream create fooOut --definition "tcp|file" Created new stream 'fooOut' xd:>stream create fooIN --definition "time|tcp"  *Stack Trace Attached*
R1013. If stream fails to create while using sources or sinks that need ports.  Ports are not released.  If while creating a stream you see: "Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Failed to bind to: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:9000. Possibly the port is already in use." then destroy the stream (or all streams for that matter) you will not be able to create another stream that uses that port.    The work around is to cycle the container.
R1014. When sending data to the TCP Source if the data is not terminated with a \r\n when the socket is closed by the client, XD throws an exception.  
R1015. Need to be able to test the following sources:  TCP, HTTP, Time,
R1016. When sending a launch request, the message is not targeted to the container node that hosts the deployed job.  With RabbitMQ, the message is not ack'd so it will get picked up eventually by the container that hosts the deployed job.  This should change to a targeted message.  ----- Original description from Thomas below  Tried deploying some batch jobs and they all seem to fail when running admin and one container using redis as transport  xd:>job create mongojob --definition "hdfsmongodb --resources=/data/*.log --names=col1,col2,col3 --idField=col1 --collectionName=test"  fails with this: {quote} 18:19:01,612  WARN redisInboundAdapter-redis:queue-inbound-channel-adapter6 boot.SpringApplication:635 - Error handling failed (Error creating bean with name 'integrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping': Initialization of bean failed;

R1018. When the job is run with its jobParameters by SimpleJobLauncher, its lastJobExecution's stepExecutions are checked for UNKNOWN status to throw JobRestartException.  It looks like the stepExecutions for the lastJobExecution are never set and the collection 'stepExecutions' is not fetched from job repository.    Hence, not sure if the following condition in SimpleJobLauncher's run(final Job job, final JobParameters jobParameters)  would ever get executed:    for (StepExecution execution : lastExecution.getStepExecutions()) {  				if (execution.getStatus() == BatchStatus.UNKNOWN) {  					//throw  					throw new JobRestartException("Step [" + execution.getStepName() + "] is of status UNKNOWN");  				}//end if  			}//end for
R1019. This will have an effect on both singlenode and distributed mode as   described below...    *singlenode:*    Currently, when running in singlenode mode, an embedded ZooKeeper server is started, and it discovers an available port for client connections and exposes it via a getClientPort() method.    With this change, IF a client connect string is provided explicitly, the embedded ZooKeeper server should not be started, but instead the client connection should be established using that explicitly provided connect string. SEE the "todo" comment above the `SpringApplicationBuilder admin` line within `SingleNodeApplication`.    *distributed:*    Currently, when running in distributed mode, the client connect string is hardcoded to `localhost:2181`. Obviously that is only a short term solution since a real-world distributed runtime would span multiple machines (including the ZooKeeper ensemble itself). That is also why the connect string must support a comma-delimited list of `host:port` values (for redundancy), but the constructor for `ZooKeeperConnection` that accepts a client connect string already supports that via the underlying `CuratorFramework` builder.    With this change, a command-line argument for the client connect string will be passed into the `ZooKeeperConnection` constructor, within the configuration (e.g. SEE the "todo" statement within `ContainerServerApplication.DistributedZooKeeperConnectionConfiguration`).
R1020. After the container/singlenode is up and running, the application does not update the singlenode.log or containernode.log.  create a stream "time|log".  you will see the timestamp in your console, but it will not be in the log.
R1021.    The container will not start with JMX enabled and the management_port set.  The stacktrace is attached and the settings for the container are enumerated below:      export endpoints_jmx_enabled=true     export endpoints_jmx_uniqueNames=true     export endpoints_jolokia_enabled=true     export XD_JMX_ENABLED=true     export management_port=15005
R1022. This will require a ZooKeeperConnection in AdminServerApplication, based on singlenode vs. distributed (via profiles, see: ContainerServerApplication for an example).    Then a PathChildrenCache should be established for the /xd/containers node.
R1023. This should also enable removal of any StreamDefinitionRepository code.    The state should be written as a data node at the stream level (e.g. /xd/streams/mystream {state=...})    For now we at least need to support the boolean --deploy=true|false flag. If that is true, then the leader Admin will deploy the modules of the stream across available containers (XD-1399)
R1024. The Stream deployment requests will be written to /xd/streams/streamname and the data on that node will include the state or a boolean indicator (for now) of whether it should be deployed.    When a Stream is deployed, the leader will consult its Container cache and write the modules to the various /xd/deployments child nodes (see XD-1400).
R1025. The Admin leader will write each Module deployment request to a child node of /xd/deployments for a selected Container (see XD-1399). That Container-specific (persistent) child node needs to be created by the Container at the same time as it creates its ephemeral node under /xd/containers.    The Container should then deploy the Module. If that same node is subsequently deleted, the Container should undeploy the Module.
R1026. A reactor based TCP module that would support some basic CODECS.    Should evaluate if this new TCP module would subsume the current reactor-syslog module functionality or if the reactor-syslog module should be enhanced/upgradted.
R1027. A module that could be used in a stream definition such as     reactor --bind tcp://0.0.0.0:3000/length?codec=bytes | do-stuff | throughput-sampler    where throughput-sampler could start measurements once a key 'START' is found in a Message and stop when the key 'STOP' is found in a Message, listing the number of msgs/sec etc.
R1028. The application should live in  in spring-xd-samples repository.    The stream created in https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-1402 should be documented how to run a benchmark and made easy to execute.  Can use ruby/bash-awk-sed to generate traffic via sendfile in order to saturate the stream.  
R1029. All the XD artifacts dependencies need to be updated with the versions that in line with Spring IO platform's standard versioning.  
R1030. Currently, XD hast "testCompile" dependency to use org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.2.1.   The spring-integration-groovy uses "2.2.2" and it is what spring IO platform uses as well. To keep it all same, we can change this "testCompile" dependency to use "2.2.2"
R1031. The throughput module would expect a payload of the type Message<byte[]> and look for the byte[] to be START or STOP strings to trigger a throughput measurement.    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/tree/master/extensions would be the place for the module to live.
R1032. The ContainerServerApplication has a bean ContainerMetaData whose ID is equal to the ContainerServerApplication context's ID.   The ContainerMetadata is alway referred (using @Autowired) in ContainerConfiguration class and this injects a new bean whose containerID is different from that of the containerID created at ContainerServerApplication. Also, this is the ID that gets stored as the container ID in znode for /xd/containers by ContainerRegistrar.  We should avoid having duplicate container metadata and the container ID needs to be same as that of the ContainerServerApplication's context ID.
R1033. Startup zookeeper on EC2 cluster instances.
R1034. Create an xd-yarn script that is more "Cloud Foundry" like -     xd-yarn push -p <path-to-unzipped-yearn-distro>  xd-yarn start admin  xd-yarn start container  
R1035. I was in the process of rewriting transform using profiles (see ExpressionOrScriptMixin).  This broke eg ModuleCommandTests.testComposedModulesValuesInDefinition because basically composed module options activate no profile.  The problem is that there is no real way to know what to activate currently, because when deploying a part of a composed module, its metadata is actually a link to the *whole* metadata, but does not really know which part.  Long story short, something we may be able to do is to activate the union of all profiles, but this breaks very easily : module compose foo --definition "transform --expr=foo | transform --script=bar"  would try to activate both "script" and "expression" profiles for both modules.
R1036. Acceptance tests has a direct library reference to spring-xd-shell.  This causes problems with eclipse.  It needs a intermediate main project to resolve the dependencies.  This is based on the conversation I had with Mark Fisher.    you cant depend on another projects' src/test  what is needed is an intermediate project… some test support project  that project would depend on spring-xd-shell (and others) … but then the spring-xd-integration-test project would depend on the intermediate one  lib dependencies should only be under src/main  src/test is intended to be scoped to the project it sits in… tests FOR that project - not reusable base classes, etc

R1038. Being able to listen to a stream at any point has a significant performance impact.  The reason for the impact is the message needs to be "serialized + transported + deserialized" to other members even if there is no one listening.  This "serialized + transported + deserialized" processes happens for each step in a flow - source | process | sink.    Recommend creating some kind of protocol for wiretaps that allows members to know if there is someone listening in the grid so they will emit the data.  Likewise we need to deregister the listener if the wiretap is deleted.
R1039. Package SpringXD into an RPM  install path = /opt/pivotal/spring-xd-1.0.0.M5  with symlink /opt/pivotal/spring-xd -> current version  init.d scripts to start/stop/status  service springxd-admin start|stop|status  service springxd-container start|stop|status  user/group = springxd/pivotal  Host springxd rpm in Pivotal repo  yum install springxd  Support RHEL/CentOS version 5 and 6? (tested on latest updates)  Support for 32 and 64 bits  Support Java 1.6 and 1.7  
R1040. This project contains core abstractions that will allow for multiple implementations of a machine learning algorithm to be implemented via integration with various existing libraries or custom code implementations.      The initial code for this has been developed in a separate github repo and is located here     https://github.com/thomasdarimont/spring-xd/tree/feature/advanced-analytics-support/spring-xd-analytics/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/analytics/model    The model can assume its use in evaluation of the model inside a stream where the data structure is a Tuple.  Note, it maybe useful to consider Message<Tuple> in case any metadata outside the core 'input data' is required to help guide the evaluation.    The build.gradle file should be updated such that there is a new build artifact spring-xd-machine-learning-analytics.jar along the lines of our other build artifacts.  Open to other naming suggestions.
R1041. Using the jppml evaluator, provide an implementation of the core abstractions in the spring-xd-machine-learning.    The initial code for this has been developed in a separate github repo and is located here    https://github.com/thomasdarimont/spring-xd/tree/feature/advanced-analytics-support/spring-xd-analytics-jpmml/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/analytics/model/jpmml 
R1042. A analytical model should be evaluated as a processor in a stream.  The model evaluation will take the input variables from a Tuple and output variable will be placed into the tuple as well.    A strawman of the stream definition can be     stream create --definition " SOURCE | jpmml ‘fraud-detection’ | PROC1 … | PROCN " --name stream1    Using profiles and playing all implementations of the analytical model in the same module lib directory, it maybe possible to select one of multiple implementations in the form     " SOURCE | analytic --library=jpmml --name=‘fraud-detection’ | PROC1 … | PROCN "    such that the core module name is the same but parameterized by what library type to use.  This may be problematic in that different libraries may have incompatible dependencies.    The analytical model can define the names of input and output fields, so at a minimum a name is required, however to easily adapt a given analytic model evaluation to a specific source modules output, it seems desirable to specify which fields are to be used as input, overriding the names of the input fields could be done in a manner such as     jpmml –name=linear-regresssion –inputFields=a,b,c 
R1043. The sample application should primarily show the 'round trip' that is possible in that "offline" analysis in R can generate a pmml flle that can be imported and evaluated in an "online" stream definition.  The specific use case can be as simple as the IRIS data set or other existing examples, such as the fraud demo.    The sample application resides in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-samples
R1044. The ordering of the lookup should be described, in particular detail on how environment variables can overrride properties.    Some details will necessarily change based on outcome of current discussion, but the overall ordering is going to remain.
R1045. The grunt build for karma unit tests is currently broken with requireJS support on the XD admin app. 
R1046. With requireJS r.js and ngmin, we need to make sure the XD admin JS files are appropriately minified. Currently, the JS files are not minified.
R1047. 3.4.6 was released on 2014.03.10:  http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/releasenotes.html    Especially relevant for us, they updated Netty from 3.2.2 to 3.6.6:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1715  
R1048. It would be nice to display container config logging with the hadoop distro and zookeeper client connect being used when the container starts up.  
R1049. Create a Shared Server Context to the Container hierarchy. This is a child of Global Beans which contains beans that are only shared by the Admin and Container contexts but not Modules. The ZooKeeper components go here to support the ZK deployment architecture. The MessageBus also goes here to support a clean way to launch jobs from the Admin process. 
R1050. By default, XD admin server uses hsqldb as data source for batch job repository and uses the default port 9101, specific database location and dbname. This makes the existence of multiple admin server on a same host not possible. 
R1051. The standard SimpleHealthIndicator that boot performs a database test that fails in xd-container since it does not require the use of a database.  
R1052. 1. Get listing of job modules  2. Remove version and action column  3. Text to say creating definitions from available modules in the UI is forthcoming, link to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Batch-Jobs#creating-a-job for how to do this in the command line.     4. Hardcode an association between spring xd out of the box module names and a description.   5. Add button to display the XML file that defines the job module  
R1053. 1. Add quick filter  2. The table should have columns for                                            name | instance | execution id    Getting the name might require a bit of extra work given some limitations with JSON serialization and cycles in the current object returned from spring batch.    3. The restart action should appear only if the job is restartable and the status was failed.  
R1054. 0. Remove home page with sign in and upper right hand corner with user login info.  1. Change the word template to modules in the tab  2. Different text for each of the tabs, “modules, definition, deployments, scheduled�?  3. Definitions tab to have text along the lines "“allows you to deploy  and undeploy batch job definitions" add links to help on how to do that in the CLI.  4. Deployments tab   a   creating new definitions, - parameters needs to be space on parameters,  “Job Parameters for Job XYZ�? after clicking launch.   b. comment out scheduler button   c. add quick filter  5. Scheduler tab   a. comment out tab  
R1055. See report at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/661    This should not happen as the module holds the classes that hold the classloader, but who knows. An integration test that verifies this would be nice, albeit tricky.
R1056. See report at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/661  It would be good indeed to allow this (eg by having a WeakHashMap<Classloader, type+name> map in the global context). The caveat though, is that any statics used by the module would be shared too. We can make this an opt-out though (I think that sharing by default makes sense) by having a flag in the module .properties manifest
R1057. The description in the google doc     https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/12Cboa7nyVVKVxDIsHLJ-68m5f78ayXn14EJLrclJYVg/edit?usp=sharing    describes the usage of XD_MODULE_CONFIG_LOCATION and XD_MODULE_CONFIG_NAME
R1058. Please see the discussion here:    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/655/files#r10892925
R1059. Update to Spring for Apache Hadoop 2.0 RC3 Add support for new hadoop distros:  - Pivotal HD 2.0 (phd20) - Hortonworks HDP 2.1 (hdp21) - Cloudera CDH5 (cdh5)  
R1060. In order to support ingestion from stdin, the suggested approach is to do the following.    xd:>stream create --definition "tcp --decoder=LF | log" --name foo    $ cat my.log | netcat localhost 1234    So while this is really a tcp based ingestion case, once can use pipe or redirect of stdin/err in order to achieve the same goal.  It should appear as a source module in the docs on par with other source modules in its own section.  
R1061. When a REST client of SpringXD (i.e., a dashboard) attempts to query (GET) a metric (e.g., counter, gauge, etc.) that does not exist the admin sever logs an ERROR and a large stack trace (attached).  In usage of Spring XD we see this frequently because a dashboard is running but the streams and counters have not been created quite yet, or initialized by messages flowing through the streams.  With a polling dashboard this results in a lot of distracting and large stack traces in the logs that are not actually issues.      I would suggest logging a one line warning or info message instead of the error and stack trace. 
R1062. Get minimal compilation going in Travis.  Redis/Rabbit services can be done in a separate story.
R1063. Attempts to create/use/undeploy a stream involving the http module will result in an OOME stating that VM could not create native thread.

R1064. With the addition of zookeeper, a user does not have to specify rabbit or redis for the control channel.   This story should allow a user to specify redis, rabbit or no control channel.
R1065. Replace tests and throws in the XdEc2Validation with asserts in the following methods:  verifyTestContent  verifyLogContent  verifySendCounts    VerifySendCounts should check for the exact number of Jmx events instead of >0.
R1066. With the addition of sinks and sources that require connections with external entities (hadoop, JMS, JDBC, ...)  the environment setup is getting unwieldy.    * Integrate SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class into acceptance tests.  * Retrieve environment variables via Dependency injection from application.properties.  * Utilize profiles for     --local single node    --local cluster    --ec2 single node    --ec2 cluster
R1067. Originally it was placed in the code to prevent overtasking our servers with downloads when people want to install XD.  And to allow for faster downloads.  However XD Jars are already placed on S3, so this feature is no longer needed.
R1068. Typical case is with a module that contains {noformat} ... user="${username}" ... /> {noformat}  (say, as part of a jdbc connection configuration) and no value has been given at deployment time.  The module may pickup a value from the environment by mistake (typically from an environment variable of the same name). This was even more problematic when ordering of property sources was unclear, but should be prevented entirely anyway.
R1069. After some discussion and voting, we decided to remove "jmxEnabled" as a command line option and have JMX enabled by default.  This can be disabled from xd-config.yml externally.
R1070. The tests that use HDFS currently require an external Hadoop installation and is hard to set up/update version in all the environments where we want to run tests, e.g. bamboo, travis.    See if the mini-cluster described in     http://docs.spring.io/spring-hadoop/docs/2.0.0.RC1/reference/html/testing.html#testing:yarn:minicluster    can be used in the test cases instead.
R1071. AggregateCounter needs a test case along the lines of of org.springframework.xd.analytics.metrics.integration.FieldValueCounterHandlerTests that will demonstrate the base functionality of the module as well as use of the  timeField and dateFormat options.
R1072. This would get rid of the CF specific post module, keeping the general abstraction of 'http' source across CF and non-CF environments.
R1073. Currently on snapshots, which is oddly pulling in groovy 2.1.0
R1074. change     "/jolokia/list";    to     "/management/jolokia/list";    etc.
R1075. {noformat}  	correlation-strategy-expression="${correlation:'${xd.stream.name}}'"  {noformat}  should be  {noformat}  	correlation-strategy-expression="${correlation:'${xd.stream.name}'}"  {noformat}  Add a test to make sure correlation expressions here work.
R1076. To avoid CL conflicts, a short term solution to this problem is to make sure that there is only one copy of jackson related classes and have them live in xd/lib.    using  jackson-core-2.3.2.jar jackson-databind-2.3.2.jar jackson-core-asl-1.9.13.jar jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.13.jar  are the latest versions and the ones to use.  There maybe other libraries that we duplicate in the same manner, we will need to investigate as well as part of another issue.  Typical error is:  java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint violation: when resolving method "org.springframework.http.converter.json.MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter.setObjectMapper(Lcom/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper;)V" the class loader (instance of org/springframework/xd/module/support/ParentLastURLClassLoader) of the current class, org/springframework/social/twitter/api/impl/TwitterTemplate, and the class loader (instance of sun/misc/Launcher$AppClassLoader) for resolved class, org/springframework/http/converter/json/MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter, have different Class objects for the type com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper used in the signature 
R1077. all state about the running system (containers, streams, and jobs) should be available via ZK, and ultimately the --store option should not be needed    1.

R1078. If a module e.g. always expects the payload of the message to be of a certain java type if would be good for documentation and convenience reasons in order to specify a default value for the --inputType option.     documentation = output for module info  convenience = we could e.g. support to always accept a Json payload (or automatic message payload conversion once it is extensible)    currently, adding  options.inputType.default  to the module's property file has no effect    I've also tried to "redefine" it using  options.inputType.description  This leads to the following exception:    Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Module option named 'outputType' is present in several delegates: [org.springframework.xd.module.options.SimpleModuleOptionsMetadata@3c1d635a, FlattenedCompositeModuleOptionsMetadata  [outputType] => PojoModuleOptionsMetadata backed by class org.springframework.xd.dirt.plugins.stream.ModuleTypeConversionPluginMetadataResolver$OutputOptionsMetadata, defining options [[ModuleOption [name=outputType, type=class org.springframework.util.MimeType, defaultValue=null, description=how this module should emit messages it produces]]]  [inputType] => PojoModuleOptionsMetadata backed by class org.springframework.xd.dirt.plugins.stream.ModuleTypeConversionPluginMetadataResolver$InputOptionsMetadata, defining options [[ModuleOption [name=inputType, type=class org.springframework.util.MimeType, defaultValue=null, description=how this module should interpret messages it consumes]]]]
R1079. {code}  StreamDefinition sd = streamParser.parse(name, dslText);  {code}    We should also consider explicit methods such as parseStream (so that parseJob and parseComposedModule are at least separate methods, if not separate parser classes that share the common parser support class that is the core of today's parser). The parsing for "completion providers" should probably be spun off to its own class as well. In the end, there should be no need for a ParsingContext enum but rather, more explicitly named methods and dedicated classes if that seems like the right approach.    the StreamDefinition should be composed of "ModuleDescriptors" (that name is not set in stone) and other Stream-level metadata like source/sink channels    consider merging some of StreamFactory code there, and the rest into StreamDeployer    merge ModuleDescriptor and ModuleDeploymentRequest as part of this effort (again, a new name could be considered, but ModuleDescriptor should take precedence over ModuleDeploymentRequest), and note in the process that ModuleDescriptor was originally designed to be immutable (taking constructor args), but as we migrated the prototype code into XD itself, this was violated. We may want to consider a builder approach, and we likely want to avoid the need for a ModuleDefinition within the ModuleDescriptor.
R1080. Currently we have many catch(Exception) blocks that simply wrap and rethrow RuntimeExceptions. We should create at least a top-level RuntimeException of our own, within the XD Exception hierarchy, and possibly a hierarchy of RuntimeExceptions extending from that, and mapping to the various checked Exceptions that can occur in ZooKeeper data access.    Also, we should not be re-wrapping those Exceptions that are already RuntimeExceptions, so we should consider a ZooKeeperExceptionHandler (and although I'm typically hesitant to recommend it, this might be a case where a static util method is the right approach).  
R1081. This should be included on the wiki, providing a thorough overview of how the distributed runtime works under-the-hood, including details of the various ZooKeeper nodes and associated watchers, etc. For example, it should describe the role of *any* Admin as a provider of the REST API as well as the specific roles allocated to the single *leader* Admin. It should describe Module recovery after Container failure, as well as some description of various failure scenarios (crashed JVM, network partition, etc) and how the recovery should be expected to occur (e.g. in some cases it will be nearly immediate, and in other cases it will be after a timed out connection). Intentional Container shutdown should be included in that discussion as well. At many points, this doc could link back to items that we also need to add to the main User Guide, such as the description of ContainerMatcher as the strategy for an Admin to determine which Container(s) should deploy a given Module, since that ContainerMatcher is used not only for the initial deployment, but also any redeployment that may be necessary.
R1082. The two classes in question are:  * org.springframework.xd.dirt.cluster.Container  * org.springframework.xd.dirt.container.ContainerMetadata    The former is currently used by the Admin when making decisions about Module deployment. That latter was a replacement for RuntimeContainerInforEntity as we migrated the various Redis/InMemory Repositories to use the data that is now available in ZooKeeper instead.    The ContainerRepository is currently used by the Admin leader, and the ContainerMetadataRepository is used by the REST endpoint that supports the xd-shell's 'runtime containers' command. Perhaps those can also be merged.    In any case, if not addressed by a larger refactoring, the ContainerRepository should probably support an Iterable return rather than an Iterator. Having finders (e.g. for attribute key/values such as "group"=="foo") might be convenient for various Module deployment strategies.
R1083. All of the following are currently defined in META-INF/spring-xd/internal/repositories.xml (among others, like Stream/StreamDefinition and Job/JobDefinition repos):    {code}  combine some of these (in repositories.xml) and reconsider the use of Repository abstractions everywhere:     <bean id="containerMetadataRepository" class="org.springframework.xd.dirt.container.store.ZooKeeperContainerMetadataRepository"/>     <bean id="moduleMetadataRepository" class="org.springframework.xd.dirt.module.store.ZooKeeperModuleMetadataRepository" />     <bean id="moduleDependencyRepository" class="org.springframework.xd.dirt.module.store.ZooKeeperModuleDependencyRepository"/>     <bean id="moduleDefinitionRepository" class="org.springframework.xd.dirt.module.store.ZooKeeperModuleDefinitionRepository"/>  {code}    At the very least the Module repositories could be combined, and also we should remove ModuleDefinitionRepositoryUtils that provides static utility methods (since we no longer need that for reuse across multiple repo impls).    Finally, we should reconsider the use of actual Repository interfaces for these, since in most cases there are only one or two methods being called. Thus, it's not necessary to support the full range of CRUD operations for which those Repository interfaces are intended.
R1084. Currently the index is used globally but applied to a range of candidates that can differ based on the match criteria per invocation.
R1085. Also likely rename, remove, or replace that Module (maybe can be supplanted by ModuleDescriptor when used in the refactored parser).    Also, considering the "url" property is not necessary (vestige of the prototype), all we'd be left with here is the Module name and type, which are used to identify a Module uniquely. Therefore this Module could be renamed to ModuleKey or something. It could be used within the StreamDefinition itself (e.g. getDescriptor(moduleKey)).
R1086. AGPL license issues
R1087. The REST API for deploy should accept parameters, which provide manifest key/value pairs (e.g. ?http.instances=5). Ultimately we will want to support passing a named manifest which had been stored previously.    The 'stream deploy' shell command should support passing these as --options.    Initially we should support [modulename].instances and [modulename].group.
R1088. Currently it watches /xd/deployments/[containerid], but due to the reuse of that top level node for XD-1483 and XD-1484, we should instead use /xd/deployments/modules/[containerid]
R1089. The analytics project has been used as a host for common repository classes because it was easily visible by both -dirt and other stuff (can't remember which)  This should be cleaned and a dedicated project for "core", "utility", "re-usable", "whatever" classes should be created

R1100. Update code to use the management/jolokia endpoint.
R1101. Describe the algorithm as defined in https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/12Cboa7nyVVKVxDIsHLJ-68m5f78ayXn14EJLrclJYVg/edit?usp=sharing    
R1102. When a container is started, the leader admin will scan the deployed streams to determine if any have modules that need to be deployed on the new container.     When a stream is deployed, the leader admin will select containers to deploy modules to.    If a new container and stream are deployed at the same time, there is the window for a race condition where both attempt to deploy a module to a container. This can be solved by (at least one) of the following:    * Consider using a single thread in the admin leader to handle all ZooKeeper updates. This means that the handling of new containers and stream deployment requests will not happen concurrently.  * Trap the {{NodeExists}} exception when creating the {{/xd/deployments/modules/...}} node in ZooKeeper
R1103. Invoking {{Paths.ensurePath}} is creating a default value of the host IP address instead of the expected "empty" value.

R1105. The admin leader performs module deployment requests by listening to stream deployment requests under {{/xd/deployments/streams}} and by listening to containers joining and leaving the cluster under {{/xd/containers}}. Refactor any duplicate code into a common class/component that can be used by both listeners.    *Edit:* the listener duplication will be handled in XD-1548. This issue is for the duplicate code in {{ModuleDeploymentRequest}} and {{ModuleDescriptor}}.
R1106. See: ContainerListener.loadStream() and StreamListener.onChildAdded(). Both require the stream definition as well as stream deployment manifest.

R1109. The jobs aren't spread evenly across available container nodes as they are created/deployed. I had 3 nodes but only one has the job modules.

R1111.  INFO main zookeeper.ZooKeeper:100 - Client environment:java.class.path    produces a huge amount of output and is rather distracting, if that specific entry could be at a log level of debug it would make the startup of the server look cleaner.
R1112. https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-1343 and related issues.
R1113. With the introduction of the deployment manifest setting this to false makes it easier to use the deployment manifest, which is the main use-case scenario.  
R1114. This will allow us to use multiple instances of  hdfs/file sinks and not have any filename/path collisions.
R1115. When a container joins the cluster, the leader admin will assign modules to it that are unassigned. It needs to also check for job modules and deploy them if required.
R1116. Currently _deployments - with an understore in XDController should be something else.  Need to segment up the url space better for stream/jobs to avoid a clash.
R1117. oracle, gemfire xd (derby should be the dialect), and sybase
R1118. See XD-1283.  We've been waiting for 1283 to change constructs like  {noformat}  attr="${name:${xd.stream.name}}"    to just  {noformat}  attr="${name}"  {noformat}      Turns out we can simply push down the ${xd.stream.name} bit in the default value (most likely initialization of a field in a POJO metadata class) and it will work just fine.    We can also consider:  - providing a fake value for those placeholders to use when doing "module info" (ie user will see  "<name of the stream>" instead of "${xd.stream.name}"      
R1119. The setting of the xd.stream.name property is currently duplicated in StreamPlugin and JobPlugin, etc  Moreover, there is no strong String constant to reference it    Create a plugin dedicated to those matters (namely making bits of DeploymentMetadata available to the module environment)
R1120. Should mention jolokia, how to turn on/off boot/jolokia http metric/monitoring and jmx.    Mention the naming strategy to identify modules running in a stream.
R1121.

R1131. if you mess up you consumerSecret,  then deploy the stream, it will throw a 403, which is correct. Then you destroy, recreate, and redeploy with the correct key, source will not retrieve  any results.  The only solution was to bounce the single node.  Steps to repeat. 1) create a stream.  stream create twit --definition "twittersearch --consumerKey=goodkey --consumerSecret=badsecret --query='Letterman'|log" 2) deploy stream and get 403 3) destroy stream 4) create twittersearch stream with good keys 5) deploy stream 6) No twitter data is displayed

R1135. Use of FsShell in AbstractHdfsWriter.initializeCounterIfNecessary() causes MaprFS to throw an unimplemented operation exception.  Replacing the FsShell code with FileSystem.listStatus allows it to be used with MaprFs.
R1136. Need to update instructions to discuss the setup of the relational database requirement for the xd-admin.
R1137. Currently in order to deploy a user created job we copy the job to the containers and admin server, and then bounce the servers.  The tests will need the ability to copy these jobs to the containers, & admin and then bounce the servers.   These sample jobs are located at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-samples

R1141. {{ContainerListener}}, {{StreamListener}}, and {{JobListener}} have duplicate code for deploying and undeploying modules. This needs to be consolidated. One possibility is for the deployment code to live in classes named {{StreamDeployer}} and {{JobDeployer}}.
R1142. When a deployment fails on a container due to a misconfiguration, the container does not notify the admin. Instead the admin waits for the container to write out an ephemeral node to the definition path {{/xd/streams}} or {{/xd/jobs}} to indicate a successful deployment and if the path isn't written in 10 seconds the deployment is considered failed.    This "timeout" should be considered a heuristic failure, meaning that the container was not able to write out a response of success or failure. If the deployment fails, the container needs to indicate this by writing a node to ZK.

R1145. Since transport is now shared by Admin and Container, a command line arg is not appropriate since it allows the user to set them to different values which would break XD. The recommend way to configure transport is in servers.yml.  The command line arg is still valid for single node

R1157. When testing in both singlenode and cluster (redis), XD throws exception (stacktrace attached).  The file is created on hdfs, but it is empty.    [Steps to recreate Using Hadoop12]  1) job create myjob --definition "filepollhdfs --names=forename,surname,address" --deploy   2) stream create csvStream --definition "file --ref=true --dir=/tmp/dug --pattern=*.csv > queue:job:myjob" --deploy  3) use excel to create a 3 column spreadsheet and save as csv.   4) Copy csv to /tmp/dug directory
R1158. Similar to XD-1565  so I'd link these 2 together.    [Steps to reproduce on Hadoop12]  1) Created Table People with columns forename,surname and address (use the result from filejdbc)  2) job create myjob --definition "jdbchdfs --sql='select col1,col2,col3 from some_table'"  3)job launch myjob  4) myjob is created on hdfs but with zero bytes  5) throws an exception, stack trace attached.
R1159. XD-EC2 must use environment variable XD_TRANSPORT instead of --transport to declare data-transport for XD.
R1160. e.g. Need to update this section (maybe others):  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Running-Distributed-Mode    Remove all mentions of Control Bus, and replace any mentions of the --transport cmd line arg with the xd.transport property in yml.  
R1161. the --transport option allows 'udp' as well as 'tcp/
R1162. When a module is deployed, it doesn't use Jolokia auto configuration (which requires an embedded servlet container configuration). But, the module context isn't using a servlet context.    From SimpleModule:    application = new SpringApplicationBuilder().sources(PropertyPlaceholderAutoConfiguration.class).web(false);     and hence, the MBeans that are exposed by the deployed modules aren't accessible via Jolokia.  We definitely don't want SimpleModule to use web application context but we need to figure out if we can use the container's management port to expose the deployed modules MBeans via jolokia.  
R1163. We don't want jline1 anymore.  This shows in IDE only (either run shell integration tests, or run the shell as Gunnar mentioned)

R1165. The first 2 images in the documentation section linked below should no longer show redis, rabbit, or local for the communication between Admins and Containers. Rather we need to show ZooKeeper.    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Architecture
R1166. In this case we will use environment variables to set the JDBC sink settings.  Thus we will just remove code.
R1167. Currently the reactor-syslog source module only supports TCP.    Once we add UDP support, we can probably remove the existing syslog-tcp and syslog-udp modules.
R1168. There are some properties files in the config directory that no longer are needed. We should clean that up and also remove/update any documentation references to these files
R1169. Once the container starts up and the module is deployed, the externalized module configuration properties could not be changed for the subsequent modules of same type.    Here is the scenario for a stream "http | transform | log", with XD_MODULE_CONFIG_LOCATION and XD_MODULE_CONFIG_NAME using their default values.   In, ${xd.config.home}/modules/modules.yml, I have:  processor:    transform:      expression: "'Inside modules.yml'"    and, in, ${xd.config.home}/modules/processor/transform/transform.properties, I have:  expression: "'First module: inside transform.properties'"    Now, I deploy this stream: "http | transform | log".    Lets say, I have another stream that uses the transform module, but this time I want to change the expression in ${xd.config.home}/modules/processor/transform/transform.properties to,  expression: "'Second module'"    Now, when the stream containing this transform module gets deployed, it uses the same transform.properties that is used by the previously deployed transform module.    What I understand from this behavior is that, the EnvironmentAwareModuleOptionsMetadataResolver caches the module environments for a given module type and name. When the same module is deployed from a given stream again, it uses the stored module environment and doesn't refresh/load the property sources from the module config locations mentioned above. Though this is good in one way that same module environment is re-used, changing the externalized module config properties would have no affect after the first module of same type/name is deployed.    Though the EnvironmentAwareModuleOptionsMetadataResolver is used by both admin and container, this JIRA focuses more on the container side.  There is one valid point with the current behavior where the module environment is cached and won't change. But is this by design?

If and when this container reconnects to ZK, it can be (re)assigned modules for deployment.    This can be done via a simple undeployment; or we may even consider closing and reopening the application context.
R1171. If XD_CONFIG_LOCATION is set, then XD runtime's xd.config.home should use that. otherwise, they point to two different paths.
R1172. The "runtime modules" command can show a failure between the deployment command and the actual deployment on the container node, especially if there is a network hop.

R1174. Create an example application that demonstrates the processing / analysis from a stream of network packets.  A potential scenario could be the detection of ongoing cyber attacks by scanning for TLS packets that what to abuse a SSL vulnerability aka "heart bleed".

R1177. Provide module templates including required property keys but not values for  $XD_MODULE_CONFIG/source/twitter*/twitter*.properties. Also look for any other packaged modules that have required properties that should be statically configured and we cannot provide defaults.  The Source modules document should be more clear regarding the configuration of these properties.
R1178. in EnvironmentAwareModuleOptionsMetadataResolver::loadPropertySources, the call to merge(parentEnv) was added to inherit the active profiles of the runtime.    Sadly, it added the parentEnv property sources by side effect.    Note that the jdbc module defaults rely on this bug
R1179. Modify the PluginContextExtensionsInitializer to consume .groovy bean definitions as well as XML. 
R1180. To have a clear separation of definition vs runtime information, move the ephemeral nodes written by containers from {{/xd/streams/stream-name}} to {{/xd/deployments/streams/stream-name}}. Same for jobs.
R1181. Flatten out ephemeral nodes written by containers when deploying modules. For instance, instead of {{.../streams/moduleType/moduleLabel/container}} use {{.../streams/moduleType.moduleLabel.container}}.    This change allows us to derive state for a stream/job without having to traverse multiple layers of znodes. This is a big deal because:  * each level of children requires a network call  * Curator can only cache one level of children  
R1182. Change message-bus.xml to read     <import resource="classpath*:/META-INF/spring-xd/transports/${XD_TRANSPORT}-bus.xml"/>    So new transports may be configured in external jars
R1183. The refactoring done for M6 prevents overriding "codec" bean configured for MessageBus. Since MB is now in SharedServerContext, that context can only be altered by a custom OrderedContextInitializer, for example. There is currently no mechanism provided by the BootStrapContext for dynamically loading a user's OrderedContextInitializer. 
R1184. The MessageBus interface uses the aliasHint flag when binding consumer/producer on a point-to-point channel.     Actually, the aliasHint is only needed when computing Source/Sink channel names in case named channel names. Otherwise, indexed channel names will be used for the input/output channel name.     The only place where aliasHint is used in the message bus is on the LocalMessageBus where it provides a way to choose the channel provider (direct/queue channel) based on the alias hint. Otherwise, it is not needed in message bus bindproducer/consumer.    We need to simplify this.
R1185. acknowlege-more, tx-size, prefetch-count, concurrency etc.
R1186. If the rabbit source receives a message it can't convert, a {{MessageConversionException}} is thrown and the message is rejected (and requeued), causing an endless loop.    Add an {{ErrorHandler}} to the inbound adapter to detect and convert {{MCE}} to {{AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException}}.    Also consider adding a retry interceptor to do the same for exceptions in modules (when using local transport).
R1187. The messagebus implementations, upon registration of consumer and producer from/to messagebus the corresponding endpoints start. Instead of directly calling the start() on adapter/consumer we can call the corresponding Binding's start() which calls the underlying endpoint to start.   This is in-line with the way the corresponding endpoints are stopped (using Binding's stop()) during undeploy/destroy.
R1188. This is currently in the M6 pom:      <organization>      <name>SpringSource</name>      <url>http://springsource.org</url>    </organization>  
R1189. Since the batch job repository is not intended to be deleted, it is possible to have a batch job that already exists in the batch job repo even if the batch job definition is destroyed in XD. When a new job definition is created, we need to add a validation for the same job definition name against the batch job repository. Currently, we will only see a failure when the job is actually deployed into the container (when the batch job repository is updated during the deployment).
R1190. There seems to be some inconsistency with the naming strategy for the named channels.    For example:    If we create a job "j1", the job launching request queue name in the message broker would "job:j1". To send a launching request, we can either use "queue:job:j1" or "job:j1" (both seems to work).    If we create a stream with the named p2p channel "foo" we expect to use the syntax "queue:foo" and the message broker will have the queue name "queue:foo"    The StreamConfigParser resolves the source/sink channel names for tap to deduce the module index from the channel component: ChannelNode.resolve(StreamLookupEnvironment env)    But, in case of the named channels that have prefix "topic:" or "queue:", their names are used as is the only exception in a case where (From StreamConfigParser's eatChannelReference(boolean tapAllowed)     {code:java}  // queue:XXX  // topic:XXX  if (firstToken.data.equalsIgnoreCase("queue")) {      channelType = ChannelType.QUEUE;  }  else if (firstToken.data.equalsIgnoreCase("topic")) {      channelType = ChannelType.TOPIC;  }  // TODO: DT not sure if this is the best way to handle  // StreamConfigParserTests.substreamsWithSourceChannels()  if (channelScopeComponents.size() >= 3) {      channelScopeComponents.remove(0);  }  {code}  The above code makes sure, "queue:job:jobname" still points "job:jobname".    We need some consistency when referring to the names of queues for the named channels above. Something like this:  "queue:job:j1" for job launching request queue   and "queue:foo" for the named p2p channel queue    or, a better strategy the has consistency across the named channels.
R1191. [Problem]  On a EC2 container jms-activemq.properties was configured to use a activemq broker on a different host, it still referred to localhost.    On my local mac, I was able to updated the jms-activemq.properties with an activemq on a different host and it worked.    [work-around]  While not recommended you can set the amq.url in the jms-activemq-infrastructure-context.xml.    [Steps to reproduce]  1) Deploy a single admin/container using xd-ec2.    2) create a jms-activemq.properties file in the spring-xd-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/xd/ where it refers to a broker on another machine (ec2-54-221-32-82.compute-1.amazonaws.com).    3) Create a stream with JMS as its source.
R1192. The UI controllers in spring-xd/spring-xd-ui/app/scripts/controllers.js definitions look overly complicated to get the modularization work.   We can possibly refactor and make it look clean; especially we will follow this as the example for subsequent controllers definitions.
R1193. This fails:  {code}  xd:>stream create s --definition "http | transform --expression='hi'+payload | log"    Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: XD115E:(pos 34): unexpected data in stream definition '+'  http | transform --expression='hi'+payload | log  {code}    But this works:  {code}  xd:>stream create s --definition "http | transform --expression=payload+'hi' | log"    Created new stream 's'  {code}  
R1194. If the job display command is executed for JobExecution and StepExecution list, it may be possible that the Job/Step execution's endTime still null (because the status is still unknown and not completed). In this case, the display command throws assertion failure here:    Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The provided date must not be null.    org.springframework.util.Assert.notNull(Assert.java:112)    org.springframework.xd.shell.util.CommonUtils.getUtcTime(CommonUtils.java:144)    org.springframework.xd.shell.command.JobCommands.display(JobCommands.java:249)
R1195. Secure Admin UI to challenge users to enter username and password to gain access.
R1196. This task will require additional Jiras in XD or also Batch. Currently we don't capture Step types.
R1197. Some of the tests in JobCommandTests use the verification of shell command results table row on a specific row (mostly first row) like this:    String id = jobExecutions.getRows().get(0).getValue(1);  		displayJobExecution(id);    It is possible that the list of table rows may have the intended row in different order. This poses inconsistent test failures. 
R1198. Will require additional server-side Jiras
R1199. This may require additional support (Jiras) for Spring Batch
R1200. This may be broken up into multiple Jira issues. Provide a generic approach to render Batch jobs graphically.   Second, especially for Hadoop components - Provide step-type-dependent renderings of Batch components - see: XD-1622
R1201. * Show only the jobs that you have created vs. those of others. (Requires Security - e.g. XD-1616) - Probably a separate issue    * Show only jobs that are in a specific status/state,  running vs. other states.  * Show only jobs for the past x number of days.  * Show only jobs whose name matches a simple string, e.g. ‘userAnalysis’  
R1202. To configure Rabbit HA a naming convention should be used to identify the queue that need to be mirrored.  
R1203. Between M5 and M6 the size of the shell/lib directory went up ~50 MB.  Investigate and remove jars from being packaged that are not used.
R1204. Options that are not covered:  --codec  --idleTimeout  --inUsePrefix  --inUseSuffix  --inputType  --overwrite    Options Renamed:  --filename is now --fileName
R1205. There seems to be some cross talk among the shell integration tests.   It looks like the same singlenode application might get shared among the test classes when they run in parallel.    Using unique queue names across the tests seem to fix the issue for now.
R1206. It looks like the singlenode application used by each of the shell integration test class is shared by other test classes as well. This causes some issues that are common to these tests. We need to avoid such scenarios.
R1207. If you mouse over any of the examples in the documentation, the grey boxes, containing code, shell commands, etc., typically in the upper right hand corner a label for the type of code/example will appear.  E.g., 'Ruby', 'Javascript' ,etc.      1) The labels that appear seem to be random and incorrect.  Shell scripts show as 'Ruby' and 'Javascript'.    2) More importantly, on some of the examples the label appears in front of and part of the example, corrupting the example.  To see this hover your mouse over the two examples, grey boxes, here: http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M6/reference/html/#_xd_shell_in_distributed_mode    There may be more but this is the ones I noticed.      -Derek
R1208. When working w/ SXD xd-singlenode, out of the box, it defaults to using all embedded components (transport, analytics, hsqldb, & zookeeper), which is easy and a great way to get going.  This is also great for development.    When I then started trying out the M6 distributed mode I set my transport to rabbit in servers.yaml (now that the --transport option is gone).  Rabbit is my preferred transport here.    I then went back to running the singlenode, for simplicity, and then got an exception saying that the singlenode couldn't contact RabbitMQ/AMQP (I was no longer running rabbit).  I then had to add the '--transport local' flag back to xd-singlenode.      Having the --transport option on xd-singlenode but not on xd-container is confusing.  Also I would expect xd-singlenode to default to local transport unless I specify another option in --transport.    -Derek
R1209. JSHint should be enabled in grunt build. There are few minor issues and needs to be fixed.   
R1210. following the HTCondor model for resource assignment, the use of a 'rank' expression that evaluates to an integer is used to order the containers that match the current 'criteria' expression.  This allows you to setup ranks such as 'prefer the machine with the most free memory' or 'prefer a machine from groupa'  (higher rank values match first).  From HTCondor Presentation Rank * The rank expression is evaluated into a number for every potential matching machine. * A machine with a higher number will be preferred over a machine with a lower number.  Rank Examples  * Prefer machines with more Mips: ** Rank = Mips  * Prefer more memory, but add 100 to the rank if the machine is Solaris 2.7: ** Rank = Memory + 100*(OpSys==“SOLARIS27)”  * Prefer machines with a high ratio of memory to cpu performance: ** Rank = Memory/Mips  * Prefer machines that will checkpoint in Bologna: ** Rank = (CkptServer==“ckpt.bo.infn.it”)   
R1211. Just as a stream or a job may state its needs and preferences for container assignment using the 'criteria' or 'rank' expressions, the xd-containers themselves can specify needs and preferences using the same 'critera' and 'rank' expressions.  These would be sent to the xd-admin server and used in the ContainerMatcher, but is evaluated using the 'stream' or 'job' as the evaluation context.  Examples  * Requirements ** Require that this container only runs streams ** Never run jobs belonging to groupA  * Rank ** Prefer to run groupB's job.  
R1212. Information related to an xd-container process and/or machine that is not static, such as 'group', e.g. free memory, number of deployed streams, should be available for use as variables in the evaluation context of the criteria SpEL expression in the admin's container matcher.  A good candidate for the source of this information are system MBeans.  See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/management/package-summary.html   
R1213. When there are multiple containers (A, B and C) and a batch job is deployed into one of the containers A. When the container A goes down, the admin server tries re-deploy the job module that was deployed in container A into other matching container. But, when the re-deployment happens, it tries to update the distributed job locator as if a new job is being deployed and following exception is thrown:    17:13:38,811 ERROR DeploymentsPathChildrenCache-0 cache.PathChildrenCache:550 -   java.lang.RuntimeException: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'job': Post-processing of the FactoryBean's object failed;

R1217. [Add JavaDocs to]  * StreamUtils  * HttpTest  * MqttTest  * JmsSource    [Exception Handling]  StreamUtils stream method should throw  IllegalStateException instead of a checked exception.  XDEc2Validation assertReceived, assertValid should throw IllegalStateException instead of a checked exception 
R1218. This change has to be facilitated because of the XD-1456 and XD-1455 stories.
R1219. Add configuration for the partition strategy to HDFS sink to support writing files into subdirectories based on a partition key provided in the header or field in the message of the stream data.    The writing using HDFS Store DataWriter should pass in the partition key value to be used for the write operation.    Partition configuration could be made available to the sink using a  --format parameter:    that could then be used in XML config like:  {code}        expression="new java.text.SimpleDateFormat('${format}').format(${timestamp})  {code}  Similar to the time source.
R1220. HDFS sink needs to have unique identifier for container id added as part of file name. Part of the file name in the directory will be the container id (GUID) - like base-path/logfile-GUID-1.txt  
R1221. There are intermittent test failurs in the StreamDeploymentIntegrationTests (especially Rabbit tests). We can try using EventuallyMatcher and see if that fixes this.
R1222. XD-1019 added simple (stateless) retry to the message bus.    Use stateful retry and an {{AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueRecoverer}} enabling failed messages to be requeued on the broker until successful (perhaps because another instance can handle the message); also provides a mechanism to route failed messages to a dead-letter exchange.    Requires setting the message id header in bus-generated messages.    Also add profiles and properties for common retry/backoff policies.
R1223. The current output type is a Java object - this raises issues wrt to consumers in other JVM that to no have the spring social tweet object in the main container classpath.  See https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-1370    Will also create another issue to update twittersearch to generate the raw twitterstream output vs. the structure of the spring social tweet object 
R1224. Do not convert the data into a spring social tweet object, pass along the json as-is from twitter search.
R1225. StubDatasetOperations class needs to be either declared asbtract or implemente inherited methods from DatasetOperations
R1226. This will reduce one extra step for getting started using XD in distributed mode 'out of the box'
R1227. Sonar build is currently failing.
R1228. Need to update the Jackson parser.
R1229. Currently, when creating the taps for streams, the name of the pub/sub channel inside the message bus would be     "tap:<name-of-the-stream>.<module-name>.<module-index>    For instance, the following stream with name "test":    http | transform --expression=payload.toLowerCase() | file    will have the exchanges as  'topic.tap:test.http.0', 'topic.tap:test.transform.1' when using rabbit message bus.    Though, the stream config parser takes care of translating what user would provide in the DSL (for example: tap:stream:test.transform.1 to use the message bus exchange topic.tap:test.transform.1), it would be better we have the consistency inside the message bus channel name as well.    Also, this would be in sync with how we name taps for jobs. (tap:job:*)
R1230. The prefix "singlenode" in embeddedHsql option property defined in singlenode profile seems to be an overhead as it only exists in singlenode profile.    Also, we don't need a system property "XD_SINGLENODE_EMBEDHSQL" as config/servers.yml can be used to override the default (from application.yml)
R1231. The streams page needs to be added to the UI at least to show the job triggers that are created while scheduling XD jobs.
R1232. When adding streams page to the UI (from XD-1667), it is necessary to modularize the angular app modules based on the functionality/components (job, stream, auth etc.,).     As we expand into more components and use cases in the UI, this definitely makes it easier to concentrate on specific modules based on the functionality.
R1233. XD-1623 introduced the dependency to a SNAPSHOT version
R1234. When a container departs the cluster the admin will try to redeploy any modules that container was running. If the stream was *destroyed* and the container exited before it had the chance to clean up its deployments under {{/xd/deployments/modules}} (for example, with {{kill -9}}) the following NPE occurs:    {noformat}  java.lang.NullPointerException    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.loadStream(ContainerListener.java:347)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.onChildLeft(ContainerListener.java:403)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.childEvent(ContainerListener.java:158)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache$5.apply(PathChildrenCache.java:494)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache$5.apply(PathChildrenCache.java:488)    org.apache.curator.framework.listen.ListenerContainer$1.run(ListenerContainer.java:92)    com.google.common.util.concurrent.MoreExecutors$SameThreadExecutorService.execute(MoreExecutors.java:293)    org.apache.curator.framework.listen.ListenerContainer.forEach(ListenerContainer.java:83)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache.callListeners(PathChildrenCache.java:485)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.EventOperation.invoke(EventOperation.java:35)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache$11.run(PathChildrenCache.java:755)    java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:471)    java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:262)    java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:471)    java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:262)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:724)  {noformat}    If the stream was *undeployed* the following stack appears:  {noformat}  15:13:06,002 ERROR ContainersPathChildrenCache-0 cache.PathChildrenCache:550 -   java.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoNodeException: KeeperErrorCode = NoNode for /xd/deployments/streams/t0    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.onChildLeft(ContainerListener.java:468)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.childEvent(ContainerListener.java:159)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache$5.apply(PathChildrenCache.java:494)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache$5.apply(PathChildrenCache.java:488)    org.apache.curator.framework.listen.ListenerContainer$1.run(ListenerContainer.java:92)    com.google.common.util.concurrent.MoreExecutors$SameThreadExecutorService.execute(MoreExecutors.java:293)    org.apache.curator.framework.listen.ListenerContainer.forEach(ListenerContainer.java:83)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache.callListeners(PathChildrenCache.java:485)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.EventOperation.invoke(EventOperation.java:35)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache$11.run(PathChildrenCache.java:755)    java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)    java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)    java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)    java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:744)  Caused by: org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoNodeException: KeeperErrorCode = NoNode for /xd/deployments/streams/t0    org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException.create(KeeperException.java:111)    org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException.create(KeeperException.java:51)    org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper.getData(ZooKeeper.java:1155)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.GetDataBuilderImpl$4.call(GetDataBuilderImpl.java:302)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.GetDataBuilderImpl$4.call(GetDataBuilderImpl.java:291)    org.apache.curator.RetryLoop.callWithRetry(RetryLoop.java:107)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.GetDataBuilderImpl.pathInForeground(GetDataBuilderImpl.java:287)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.GetDataBuilderImpl.forPath(GetDataBuilderImpl.java:279)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.GetDataBuilderImpl.forPath(GetDataBuilderImpl.java:41)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.loadStream(ContainerListener.java:358)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.onChildLeft(ContainerListener.java:417)  	... 16 more  {noformat}    In short, this logic makes the assumption that the stream is still present and deployed.

R1235. When running a query against a large dataset, JDBC will attempt to load the entire result set into memory by default.  If this isn't desired (which would be the case in the prepackaged jobs), you can set the fetchSize on the JdbcCursorItemReader to set the number of rows to return with each fetch.  It is good practice to make this match the commit interval.      If the fetch size is not set with large datasets, the stack blows with an OutOfMemoryException.

R1244. I am new to Spring XD, I want to read the jboss queue message and then want to write it into text file by using stream create comment i.e "stream create --name TEST-LOG  --definition "jms | file" --deploy". I am trying to configure the "spring-xd-1.0.0.M6\xd\modules\common\jms-jbossmq-infrastructure-context.xml" to invoke the jboss queue and read the queue message. Can you help me to do the configuration and resolve my objective?
R1245. Currently, the admin nodes that participate in the leadership election are grouped under /xd/admin. Since, there are multiple lock nodes that correspond to all the admin servers that participate in leadership election, we can pluralize this node name to /xd/admins.
R1246. * StepExecutionContext  * StepExecutionProgress  * JobScheduler  * Stream page  * Job definition (XD1615)    
R1247. We would like to experiment with open source libraries to further enrich Spring XD’s service offerings and feature-set.  This epic remains the anchor point for following categories and the respective experimentation outcomes will be documented in the associated stories.  * Measure based alerts * Log analysis * Machine learning and graph computation
R1248. We would like to experiment with “metrics”, a Java library to extract insights of production code. This will help understand the behavior of critical components to eventually orchestrate workflows to proactively monitor and notify important contacts/groups as needed.  Website -> http://metrics.codahale.com/ GitHub -> https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics
R1249. We would like to experiment with “Riemann”, a Clojure library to aggregate events from servers and applications through stream processing.   Features: * Tracking latency distribution * Email for exceptions * Memory and CPU statistics  This will help understand the behavior of critical components to eventually orchestrate workflows to proactively monitor and notify important contacts/groups as needed.   Webiste -> http://riemann.io/ GitHub -> https://github.com/aphyr/riemann
R1250. We would like to experiment with “ELK” stack. It’s the combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana to extract end-to-end real-time insights from structured and unstructured data source. Possibly provide integration endpoints to some of the components.  Features: * Search and analyze in real-time * Scrub, parse and enrich data * Visualization  Website -> http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/ GitHub -> http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/elkdownloads/
R1251. We would like to experiment with “stream-lib”, a stream summarizer and cardinality (counting distinct elements) estimator to further enrich Spring XD's analytics feature-set.  GitHub -> https://github.com/addthis/stream-lib
R1252. We would like to experiment with “GraphLab”, a graph based, high performance, distributed computation framework written in C++.   Features: * HDFS integration * Maching learning toolkits  Website -> http://graphlab.org/projects/index.html GitHub -> https://github.com/graphlab-code/graphlab  _Note: Could be part of unified offering of PHD_
R1253. Acceptance Criteria: - Users should be able to gain access using username/password - Both username/password are mandatory - Invalid user credentials should be displayed as error messages and the user will not be able to gain access
R1254. As a user, I'd like to have the option to provide security configurations so that I can access REST endpoints in a secured manner.     Ideally, all the listed [REST|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/REST-API#xd-resources] endpoints needs to be wrapped within a security layer.     *Scope of this spike:*    * Research Spring Security and Spring Boot and the OOTB features   * Design considerations and approach for XD  * Developer experience  ** How users will be configuring security credentials?  ** How DSL shell will be handled?  ** How Admin UI will be handled?
R1255. Support the ability to provide deployment properties for "job deploy".
R1256. Deploy XD Sample Gemfire on Utility Machine. Deploy stream with gemfire as a source. Create a stream (stream2) with gemfire-server as a sink Send data to stream 2 and verify that the data has been received by gemfire source. Update CI tests to increase heap, to support gemfire tests..
R1257. The hdfs sink metadata causes loading of  org.springframework.data.hadoop.store.codec.Codecs class during 'module info --name sink:hdfs' command since the type is a specific Spring Hadoop class    options.codec.description = compression codec alias name  options.codec.type = org.springframework.data.hadoop.store.codec.Codecs  options.codec.default =    Don't think we want to tie the sink module to specific Spring Hadoop classes during runtime of the admin, we can't be sure that admin has hadoop classes on classpath in all environments and there is no way of specifying the hadoop distro for admin.    Wouldn't it be better to have this option as a String to be passed in to the module's context that could then load the class
R1258. Not sure why the Hadoop classes are on the admin servers classpath. There is no way to select the distro, and the Hadoop classes shouldn't be needed except for module info for hdfs sink (see XD-1701)
R1259. We should add an easy way to configure the memory. Currently we only have the number of YARN containers configurable without diving into Spring YARN/Boot specific config options. {code} xd:     adminServers: 1     containers: 1 {code}  Proposing we do: {code} xd:     adminServers: 1     adminMemory: 512M     containers: 1     containerMemory: 512M {code}  
R1260. Document the different "onion layers" that come in play with regard to quoting and escaping (shell, xd-parser, SpEL expressions in some cases) and provide practical examples to common scenarios    
R1261. Each Hadoop distro uses different settings for "yarn.application.classpath" and we should provide some starting points for the distros we support running XD on YARN for.    We should add a commented out stub "defaultYarnClasspath" entry for phd20, cdh5 and hdp21 to replace the one for hadoop22 when someone deploys on these distros.  
R1262. Tab completion doesn't currently list/support "queue" as a source.  For example if typing the following stream: stream create b --definition "queue:bar > transform --expression=payload+'-bar' | log" --deploy  Tab completion doesn't recognize or suggest "queue" or anything after it until after the first bar "|".    The same applies to named channels, "queue", as a sink.
R1263. The example in the M6 documentation for the Dynamic Router (here: http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M6/reference/html/#dynamic-router) for the SpEL-Based Routing throws an exception when processing the message (from the HTTP post) saying "No bean named 'queue:foo' is defined", when using RabbitMQ as the transport.  I do not know a workaround.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Run RabbitMQ locally  2) Run xd-singlenode --transport rabbit  3) xd:>stream create f --definition "queue:foo > transform --expression=payload+'-foo' | log" --deploy    xd:>stream create b --definition "queue:bar > transform --expression=payload+'-bar' | log" --deploy    xd:>stream create r --definition "http | router --expression=payload.contains('a')?'queue:foo':'queue:bar'" --deploy    4) xd:>http post --data "a"    5) This should give a stacktrace:  Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No bean named 'queue:foo' is defined    org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory.getBeanDefinition(DefaultListableBeanFactory.java:641)    org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanFactory.getMergedLocalBeanDefinition(AbstractBeanFactory.java:1159)    org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanFactory.doGetBean(AbstractBeanFactory.java:282)    org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanFactory.getBean(AbstractBeanFactory.java:200)    org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanFactory.doGetBean(AbstractBeanFactory.java:273)    org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanFactory.getBean(AbstractBeanFactory.java:200)    org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanFactory.doGetBean(AbstractBeanFactory.java:273)    org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractBeanFactory.getBean(AbstractBeanFactory.java:200)    org.springframework.integration.support.channel.BeanFactoryChannelResolver.resolveDestination(BeanFactoryChannelResolver.java:99)  	... 83 more  
R1264. Upon container departure, the ContainerListener's onChildLeft() event triggers redeployment of stream/job modules that were deployed into the leaving container. During the redeployment, it happens that the container candidates from the DefaultContainerMatcher *sometimes* (based on the subset from distributeForRequestedCount(List<Container> candidates, int count))  includes the container which already have the module of the *same* stream/job definition deployed. This causes the re-deployment silently swallowing the NodeExistsException and the module being re-deployed doesn't actually get deployed.  
R1265. Currently, the flag "stoppable" on JobExecutionInfoResource is used to find if the jobExecution can be stopped.  Since this flag is set to true even if the JobExecution status is COMPLETED, the jobExecution can still say it can be stopped.
R1266. Also check the JMX output to see that the filter rejected the entry.
R1267. Update StreamUtils based on Code Review comments.
R1268. It would be neat if streams could be easily formatted. E.g:    * Make the definition name bold  * use different colors for parameter names and values    
R1269. Create a new section in the docs regaring shell usage, in particular how to represent single and double quotes.    Include some discussion of basic commands to manipulate streams, jobs and list modules.  How to pass in a file that can be executed when the shell starts up.    Also point to spring-shell ref docs for extensibility in terms of adding custom commands.
R1270. Modules can use property values in servers.yml which is very handy to keep batch and hdfs functionality working without duplication of config values in servers.yml and modules.yml (or individual modules).   The configuration section should highlight the common cases where this occurs, batch, hdfs, rabbitmq/mqtt where using the server config values as defaults is useful and that they can still be overridden.  
R1271. Based on the discussion from here:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/849#issuecomment-43215168  we need a better strategy to handle some of the queries and updates to the batch domain objects.
R1272. The TwitterSearch does a case insensitive search.  Tests need to do a insensitive check for the keywords in the search result.
R1273. After successful job deployment, the Job deployments path in ZK doesn't get updated with the data {"state": "deployed"}    Though this data is not used for deployed instance repository (org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.zookeeper.ZooKeeperJobRepository) to check for the deployment status, it may be better to have this state updated like stream deployment path.
R1274. As a consequence of not fixing XD-1289, we should document keys of the form ${xd.stream.name} that are available to users    ${xd.[stream|job].name} and ${xd.container.???} come to mind, there may be others
R1275. The current screen layout is problematic in cases where there are many deployments. Having a dedicated page for Launching or Scheduling jobs may be desirable.   Alternatively, a light-box-based approach may be possible but I personally don't favor that.
R1276. In the Module Composition example here: http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M6/reference/html/#composing-modules on of the examples is "module delete --name foo --type sink" which fails as the '--type' argument is not supported by the CLI.      There are 3 other references to the '--type' argument in the documentation which may not be supported by the CLI anymore. 
R1277. All of the CLI module commands that require the module name (e.g., 'module display source:mqtt') require that you preface the name with the module type.  If you forget to do this, e.g., 'module display mqtt', you get a fairly cryptic exception which can confuse end users.  The exception is:  java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: Failed to convert 'mqtt' to type QualifiedModuleName for option 'name,' String index out of range: -1
R1278. Based on the discussion here:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/852#issuecomment-43356579  we would like to have tests created for verifying the Stream/Job deployments path "data" 
R1279. https://build.spring.io/browse/XD-JDK8-5  apply plugin: 'jacoco'  jacoco {     toolVersion = "0.7.0.201403182114" }
R1280. Add an option to destroy the stream/job definitions.  Also add confirm action that asks for user to confirm to proceed with destroy.
R1281. Hitting this issue in Chrome:    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22891611/google-font-varela-round-doesnt-support-font-weight-in-chrome    Looks like Chrome has some issues with making text bold if the font does not explicitly support it.  
R1282. Same problem on M6 and using BUILD-SNAPSHOT.    When deploying a stream that has a slow-starting component (that connects to Gemfire), the deployment fails with a ZK NoNode exception.    No log from the component seen, but in all honesty, the component could be waiting on a timeout.    org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoNodeException: KeeperErrorCode = NoNode for /xd/deployments/modules/2af8624b-777c-4084-aa1a-9d675b53afe3/test1.sink.reactor-batching-client-1/metadata    org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException.create(KeeperException.java:111)    org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException.create(KeeperException.java:51)    org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper.create(ZooKeeper.java:783)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CreateBuilderImpl$11.call(CreateBuilderImpl.java:676)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CreateBuilderImpl$11.call(CreateBuilderImpl.java:660)    org.apache.curator.RetryLoop.callWithRetry(RetryLoop.java:107)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CreateBuilderImpl.pathInForeground(CreateBuilderImpl.java:656)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CreateBuilderImpl.protectedPathInForeground(CreateBuilderImpl.java:441)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CreateBuilderImpl.forPath(CreateBuilderImpl.java:431)    org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CreateBuilderImpl.forPath(CreateBuilderImpl.java:44)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerRegistrar.onChildAdded(ContainerRegistrar.java:370)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerRegistrar.access$800(ContainerRegistrar.java:93)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerRegistrar$DeploymentListener.childEvent(ContainerRegistrar.java:706)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache$5.apply(PathChildrenCache.java:494)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache$5.apply(PathChildrenCache.java:488)    org.apache.curator.framework.listen.ListenerContainer$1.run(ListenerContainer.java:92)    com.google.common.util.concurrent.MoreExecutors$SameThreadExecutorService.execute(MoreExecutors.java:293)    org.apache.curator.framework.listen.ListenerContainer.forEach(ListenerContainer.java:83)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache.callListeners(PathChildrenCache.java:485)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.EventOperation.invoke(EventOperation.java:35)    org.apache.curator.framework.recipes.cache.PathChildrenCache$11.run(PathChildrenCache.java:755)    java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:471)    java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:262)    java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:471)    java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:262)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
R1283. We don't support using @Configuration for modules ATM.  The current code was committed during the same time as improvements to handling module configuration.  We should switch the reactor-ip.xml to include all bean definitions and remove referencing @Configuration classes or see how to add support for @Configuration.      Another short term hack is to put the prefix 'sink.reactor-ip' in all @Value used in NetServerInboundChannelAdapterConfiguration.
R1284. JdbcHdfsTest, FileJdbcTest works for singlenode but not for admin & Container on the same machine.
R1285. Creating this enhancement story based on the discussion here:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/867
R1286. In short if you attempt to destroy a stream that has had its modules removed, the destroy will fail.  1) So if I create my own processor:x and use the processor in a stream.  2) I then shutdown the admin and container.  3) Delete the processor:x from the $XD_HOME/modules directory  4) Restart the admin and container.  5) if you do a stream list the stream that used the processor.x is still present.  6) but you can not delete the stream because of the exception below.     [To Reproduce using Payload Conversion example]  1) Follow the instructions to install and use the myTupleProcessor module in a stream.  2) Now shutdown the admin and container  3) rm -rf $XD_HOME/modules/processor/myTupleProcessor.xml   4) rm -rf $XD_HOME/lib/payload-conversion.jar  5) Startup your admin and container  6) stream all destroy.  Then type 'y'<return>     6a) The shell will report ommand failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: No content to map due to end-of-input at [Source:

R1288. It would be useful to store admin server ip address in ZooKeeper leadership group node (/xd/admins) to identify admin server and it's admin port.  
R1289. The converter was not configured, therefore String to byte[] for --outPutType application/octet-stream fails for a String payload.
R1290. The TCP source unconditionally converts to String. This prevents binary transfers.    Remove the transformer; if the user wants a String; (s)he can use    {{tcp --outputType=text/plain;charset=UTF-8}} (assuming the byte stream has valid UTF-8 encoding).    Another option would be to add a {{--binary}} option, but since conversion can already handle it, it's probably better to use that.    On the other hand, a {{--binary}} option would enable backwards compatibility.    The http source also unconditionally converts to String.

R1292. Hadoop supports namenode HA with two name nodes running, one being active and other in standby. If the active name node fails the standby name node has all the data readily available and can start serving requests. In this configuration name node url is no longer a host:port url but a logical name that translates to any active name node at runtime.     This is to ensure spring xd stream can handle a name node failure, for instance when writing a hdfs sink, seamlessly
R1293. As a developer, I'd like to have an OOTB MVC-aware HTTP module (with embedded tomcat), so I can use this module to leverage spring-mvc and spring-security features, instead of rewriting them within the existing HTTP source module.   * Adds richer support for content-type in the HTTP Source module. See [~jbrisbin] comments: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/879.  * Adds full header mapping in the source (see comments)  * See SO request: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29353471/spring-xd-as-a-rest-endpoint
R1294. We are getting test failures such as    https://build.spring.io/browse/XD-MASTER-1381    quite often in the CI environment recently.

In M5 an error was returned. 2) The status shows as "deployed" for all three.  3) Even though there are three streams. Only the first stream is active. I can post to the first stream that was declared and it will successfully post to the  directory. If  I post to the remaining streams, I don't get an error and I no data is written to the flle. 4) If I remove the working stream, the remaining stream still don't work. 
R1300. We have some places where we us a default data format specified as 'yyyy/MM/dd'. In Spring for Apache Hadoop we use 'yyyy-MM-dd' for partitioning path expressions. This seems more in line with ISO standard date format. For consistency we should have both SHDP and XD use the same default format.

R1302. Update spring-data-hadoop version to 2.0.0.RC4 and make necessary changes to the YARN configuration.
R1303. Since the module metadata properties are resolved at runtime (when the module gets deployed), we can resolve the module options values that are already resolved in there.    For example, currently the "runtime modules" command for "log" module would show this:    runtime modules    [7m[27;32m  Module            Container Id                          Options    ----------------  ------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------    s1.source.http-0  633f0fb1-5396-4bc0-8f1e-c9d5104e0ea7  {port=9000}    s1.sink.log-1     633f0fb1-5396-4bc0-8f1e-c9d5104e0ea7  {name=${xd.stream.name}, expression=payload, level=INFO}    In this case, we can resolve the module option "name" from the module metadata.

R1306. We are looking to speed up the message passing from source to sink  and wondering if we could use a in-memory transport whenever we know that source and sink modules are co-located on the same container. Currently we do not see a straight forward way of doing it    Option 1 : Create a composite module and let users deploy a composite module by itself or in other words deploy a stream with one module    Option 2 : Let users define a transport as in-memory when defining a stream. This could be used along with the deployment manifest feature enforcing co-location of a source and sink module, with in-memory transport    cc @adenissov

R1319. As part of XD-1338 we modified how module deployment works. Now module deployment requests include deployment properties as the data for the ZooKeeper node. This allows us to reuse those properties when a container exit the cluster and the module is redeployed to another container.    However if there are no other containers to handle the deployment, the module deployment node is erased, along with the properties. This mean no module will ever handle the partition that module was responsible for.    This condition needs to be handled so that partitioned streams continue to function in cases where the cluster temporarily doesn't have enough containers to support the stream.

Create OOTB batch job that executes SQL script using JDBC - can be used for Hive2 jobs or HAWQ jobs etc.  Christian Tzolov provided the following baed on Dave Syers JdbcTasklte (https://src.springframework.org/svn/spring-batch-admin/sandbox/cloud-sample/src/main/java/org/springframework/batch/admin/sample/job/JdbcTasklet.java):  Attached is a simple job module that can run sql commands on Hawq or other DB over jdbc.  Just unzip it in <springxd>/xd/modules/job folder and create something like this: xd> job create analyticsJob  --definition "     jdbc --driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver             --url=jdbc:postgresql://<HAWQ master host>:5432/gpadmin             --username=gpadmin --password=''              --sql='CREATE TABLE fonecta_demo.analytics AS                              SELECT segmenttiluokka, count(*) as cnt FROM fonecta_demo.segmenttiluokka                                    GROUP BY segmenttiluokka;'" --deploy 
R1332. Create OOTB batch job that executes a job on YARN  could be:  job create yarnJob --definition "yarnjob --containerCount=4 --applicationDir=/apps/mystuff --archiveFile=yarn-job-0.1.0.jar --arguments=#{payload[value]}"

R1334. MessageBusSupport creates an 'original content type' message header to support serialization for remote transports. The form of the header application/x-java-object;type=<classname>.  For java array types, the "[" prefix causes an error when converting this value to a MimeType.    This can be avoided by quoting the classname. However, a further complication is if the array element is an object. In this case the classname is '[L<classname>;'. The trailing colon causes a parse exception even in a quoted string.  A simple fix is to check for the trailing colon, remove it and add it back if MimeType.getParameter("type").contains("[L").   See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getName for more info.  Preliminary testing indicates primitive array and multi-dimensional arrays will work fine with quoting, but tests should be added for these cases.

R1337. XD-EC2 applies the environment variables to all container instances that are created.  This behavior has to be altered such that a environment variable can be applied to to a specific container instance.      For example if we create a 3 node cluster Admin, Container1, Container2 & Container3.  For Example:  * XD1_XD_CONTAINER_GROUPS=GROUP1  * XD2_XD_CONTAINER_GROUPS=GROUP2    * In this example XD1_XD_CONTAINER_GROUPS=GROUP1 would apply XD_CONTAINER_GROUPS=GROUP1 to container1's environment.    * XD2_XD_CONTAINER_GROUPS=GROUP2 would apply XD_CONTAINER_GROUPS=GROUP2 to container2's environment.    * While container3 would not receive a specific environment setting for XD_CONTAINER_GROUPS.  
R1338. * Create infrastructure to retrieve container data. * Create infrastructure to retrieve  Stream data and the associated container * Create tests that verify default behavior without group  * Create tests that verify behavior with sink belonging to specific group * Create tests that verify behavior with processor belonging to specific group  * Also generate tests for the scenarios above where the count >1

R1341. See comment here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/912/files#r13331190 
R1342. Some REST resources lack an @XmlRootElement annotation.  This causes a JAXB marshalling error when trying to access the API with an Accept header of xml (which is the default in most browsers)  This is a preliminary to XD-1800 (which is much more involved), only to fix ugly exception
R1343. The id field in ModuleMetadata is using module id that is derived from module parameters which varies between stream and job modules.  We can come up with ModuleId class that applies for both stream/job modules and can be used in ModuleMetadata.
R1344. The XD parser had initial support for substreams, which have been subsumed by composed modules.  That legacy code is unused and not needed
R1345. XML is currently required for module definitions. XD should also support Java @Config and Groovy bean definitions and potentially, SI DSLs. 
R1346. So that the code format matches that of the XD Project.
R1347. Add paging support for the appropriate accessor methods in ModuleMetadata/Container repositories
R1348. Theoretically I would have liked to centralize logging of Http/Resource calls global more substantially - but see this limitation:  https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4013
R1349. Deployment: Admin/Container Redis as data transport  SHA: 45e1beb    [Description]  In the case that the Redis is not running locally XD cannot connect to the Redis instance even though the environment variable spring_redis_host has been set.      [Steps to reproduce]  * Shutdown local instance of Redis.  * For both the admin and container execute the command prior to running the instances:  ** export spring_redis_host=YourRedisHost  * Start admin and container instances  * deploy a simple stream   ** You will see the following error:  13:56:59,647 ERROR task-scheduler-9 handler.LoggingHandler:145 -

R1350. If someone wants to have a dedicated location (module registry) for the custom modules and can be accessed from any Spring supported resource URL location, then we need to support.    Currently, we use Delegating ModuleRegistry which uses ResourceModuleRegistry implementations that look for location `xd.module.home` and `classpath:/modules/`.     Maybe we can add an additional ResourceModuleRegistry with `xd.custom.module.home` and use it for custom modules.
R1351. Pass module properties from stream plugin to {{MessageBusAwareChannelResolver}}.    Disallow partitioning properties.
R1352. We should have a facility to easily test the E2E Protractor tests against a variety of common browsers including IE. Sauce Labs seems to be the service to use.
R1353. Generate asciidoc fragments for each module's options, this way it is always up to date.
R1354. When redeploying in the case of a container failure the modules are now redeployed in a random order.  The list of modules in the failed container needs to be sorted based on its position in a given stream and then redeployed.
R1355. Currently, there are JOB_REGISTRY_NAMES, JOB_REGISTRY_RESTARTABLES and JOB_REGISTRY_INCREMENTABLES tables and we can possibly combine them into one table and have a better schema for this.
R1356. This issue could be more involved. Proper pagination may not be implemented correctly by the REST controller (making the respective service call).    This would also necessitate some form of improved state management for the UI. E.g.    * User is on page 5 of the listing of Job Executions  * User views details  * User presses the back-button (on the screen)  * The the listing of Job Executions *should* be still on page 5    
R1357. Support receiving messages from an HA cluster.
R1358. Spring XD should support mandatory module properties. In the UI when creating a definition from an existing Module, mandatory definition properties should be visually highlighted and enforced.  I don't think the XD backend supports this though. 
R1359. Currently JdbcSink, HdfsJdbc&  FileJdbc offer only driverClassName, url, user name & password.  They need to offer a full range of configurations offered by the Tomcat Jdbc Connection pool.
R1360. TwitterSearchTest is the only test that is dependent on an external system for its success.  As such there are times that the service is running slower than the test expects, thus the test fails un-necessarily.   Once XD-1814 is merged we can utilize the "waitForFile" feature to wait for the result file from the stream to be written.  But the wait time for twitter will be extended to 1 min.   AAAAND make the the search string configurable.  Some tests fail because the #springio is not consistently present.
R1361. Due to the way the heuristics for module type guessing work, we can't currently support completions of the like: "queue:foo > s<TAB>" that would yield valid processor names  We need to add non-determinism (list of types instead of single type) to the type guessing heuristic
R1362. When deploying a batch job, the UI displays the database password found in the server.yml in plain text to the user.  At the very least, this should be displayed in a password field so it's masked out and have it masked out in the resulting definition at the bottom of the page.  Ideally, we wouldn't provide the password on that page at all and only accept overriding options (if the user wants a password other than the configured one, enter it…otherwise, we'll use what we have).    I'm finding that this occurs in other places as well.  A full pass though of the UI should be done to mask out passwords (or eliminate their display all together).
R1363. The JMS Source/Sink has a pluggable provider (default {{activemq}}) but the URL property {{amqUrl}} implies activeMQ - the property name should be generic (found while testing XD-1149).
R1364. This will  eliminate any race conditions between deployments and containers  joining/leaving the cluster.
R1365. With XD-1311, the job execution list shows the definition/deployment status of the associated job. We need to show the same information for a given job execution.
R1366. Following the merge of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/commit/03cf962845499610ad021d9e6689bccbf5e13cef , investigate calling sites of module.getIndex() or any similar API and remove it if needed

R1368. * Currently Acceptance FileSource Acceptance Tests are failing  ** This is because the sink that tests the result for the file source test is a filesink.  Both use the "file" token.  Thus causing a failure  * SimpleFileSource and SimpleFileSink needs to support a label method.  * Update testFileSource to use the labels.
R1369. This needs closer inspection, but here are some things that currently do not work, either at the parser level, or at actual deployment time:    {noformat}  xd:>module compose foo --definition "queue:bar > filter"  Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Could not find module with name 'filter' and type 'sink'    xd:>module compose foolog --definition "queue:foo > log"   Successfully created module 'foolog' with type sink  ==> should fail (not a module, but a full stream)    xd:>module compose foo --definition "queue:bar > filter | transform"  Successfully created module 'foo' with type processor  ==> should be source  {noformat}
R1370. REST API needs to be finalized and documented for the GA release. The API to be reviewed by REST experts 
R1371. When producers are created/bound dynamically (e.g. from the router sink), they are not unbound when the module is undeployed.  There is currently no metadata in the binding to provide that functionality.  It is not critical because the producers are just sitting there (and may be reused if the module is redeployed, but it is a leak and should be addressed at some time.
R1372. When a {{LocalMessageBus}} bridges producer and consumers, it creates an internal channel and registers it with the application context. This can be a {{DirectChannel}}, a {{QueueChannel}} (for named {{queue:*}} channels) or a {{PublishSubscribeChannel}} (for named {{topic:*}} channels).  These channels remain in the context when both the producer and consumer are undeployed. It's rather benign in that the channels will be reused if the modules are redeployed, but it is a leak and should be addressed at some point. A {{QueueChannel}} should remain in the context if its queue is not empty.
R1373. Currently when a stream is deployed by {{DeploymentSupervisor}} the event thread blocks until all deployment requests have been answered or timed out. If there were any deployment errors we log a stack trace.    Instead (or in addition to) we need to write out the results of the deployment request. My initial thought is that it would go under:  {panel}  {{/xd/deployments/streams/<name>/state}}  {panel}  The data for {{state}} will be a JSON map with fields {{state}} and an optional {{errorDescription}}.
R1374. When the state of all the individual modules for a stream are collected, these states need to be examined in order to determine what the overall stream state is. These should be fed into an interface that can potentially be pluggable to handle all of the edge cases/scenarios that may arise.    One possibility is:  {noformat}  public interface DeploymentUnitStateCalculator {    	DeploymentUnit.State calculate(DeploymentUnit deploymentUnit,  			ModuleDeploymentPropertiesProvider provider,  			Collection<ModuleState> moduleStates);  }  {noformat}
R1375. {{DeploymentSupervisor}} will be responsible for maintaining the state data for each stream. When a stream is deployed, a watch should be created so that the supervisor can recalculate the state of a stream as modules are added/removed.
R1376. As part of XD-1591, {{DeploymentVerifier}} was modified to take the node structure into account. As indicated in the review below, the implementation does not take module properties (such as count) into account:    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/939/files#r13730134    This means the implementation is incorrect. For now this won't affect us since all tests at the moment are single node. However this can be drastically improved (and simplified) once XD-1270 is completed. At that point we'll be able to simply read a single ZK node to determine if/when a deployment succeeded. 
R1377. See the [design document|https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/1kWtoH_xEF1wMklzQ8AZaiuhBZWIlpCDi8G9_hAP8Fgc/edit#heading=h.2rk74f16ow4i] for more details.    This class (or perhaps a method on a repository?) will need to query ZooKeeper to obtain the state of a stream/job in order to pass it along to the REST controller.
R1378. See the [design document|https://docs.google.com/a/gopivotal.com/document/d/1kWtoH_xEF1wMklzQ8AZaiuhBZWIlpCDi8G9_hAP8Fgc/edit#heading=h.2rk74f16ow4i] for more details.    The REST controller needs to be modified to obtain stream/job state once it is available in ZooKeeper. This depends on XD-1847.
R1379. currently we have /batch and /jobs. Everything should move to /jobs. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/REST-API for details.
R1380. Upon a matching container arrival, if there are orphaned stream modules to be deployed, then following exception is thrown:    java.lang.IllegalStateException: Container missing      at org.springframework.util.Assert.state(Assert.java:385)      at org.springframework.xd.dirt.core.StreamDeploymentsPath.hasDeploymentInfo(StreamDeploymentsPath.java:275)      at org.springframework.xd.dirt.core.StreamDeploymentsPath.build(StreamDeploymentsPath.java:233)      at org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.getContainersForStreamModule(ContainerListener.java:337)      at org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.redeployStreams(ContainerListener.java:278)      at org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.onChildAdded(ContainerListener.java:186)      at org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.ContainerListener.childEvent(ContainerListener.java:155)
R1381. Add Cache implementation for ZooKeeperContainerRepository
R1382. Now that Spring HATEOAS has some support for client side consumption, we can consider using its Traverson object to replace code such as  {noformat} 		resources.put("streams/definitions", URI.create(xdRuntime.getLink("streams").getHref() + "/definitions")); 		resources.put("streams/deployments", URI.create(xdRuntime.getLink("streams").getHref() + "/deployments")); 		resources.put("jobs", URI.create(xdRuntime.getLink("jobs").getHref()));  {noformat}  in SpringXDTemplate, etc.
R1383. The Tap fixture does not need to inherit from AbstractModuleFixture  Replace moduleName method with moduleToTap.    The current tap syntax is: tap:stream:<streamname>.<modulelabel>  and not  tap:stream:<streamname>.<modulelabel>.<modulename> as currently implemented by the label fixture.  
R1384. Going forward it seems that providing Hadoop v1 will be of lesser importance and we might as well drop it now. SHDP 2.1 will also drop any v1 support.    Remove support for:  - hadoop12 - Apache Hadoop 1.2.1  - cdh4 - Cloudera CDH 4.6.0  - hdp13 - Hortonworks Data Platform 1.3    Keep:  - hadoop22 - Apache Hadoop 2.2.0 (default)  - phd1 - Pivotal HD 1.1  - phd20 - Pivotal HD 2.0  - cdh5 - Cloudera CDH 5.0.0  - hdp21 - Hortonworks Data Platform 2.1    This should make configuration and documentation easier too. Not to mention testing.    This affects startup scripts and the shell plus the build script.
R1385. We should have an --fsUri parameter for hdfs and hdfs-dataset sinks so we can write to different file systems (hdfs, webhdfs)
R1386. When using spring.hadoop.fsUri set to webhdfs://localhost/ I'm getting an error:    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/ws/rs/core/MediaType    including the following in xd/lib seems to fix this:  - jersey-core-1.9.jar  - jersey-server-1.9.jar  
R1387. See impacted code at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/951
R1388. Currently, /jobs/definitions and /batch/jobs offer similar info related to the job configuration info. The former comes from ZKJobDefinitionRepository while the latter comes from Batch Job Repository.  We need to combine this together so that it is not confusing to the end user.
R1389. Spring Boot 1.1.1 has the following change:    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/b75578d99c8d435e1f8bf18d0dbb3a2ddf56fdc4    where, an external property source precedence would get re-ordered after the application configuration properties. This change affects Spring XD config initializer which expects an external "zk-properties" property source always preceding over the application configuration properties.  
R1390. Even if not strictly necessary for all modules, use the one-dir-per-module scheme for all of them.  Care should be taken in case there are <import>
R1391. Need a way for end-user to package and add custom modules/scripts when deploying XD on YARN. Currently we have a zip file containing all code including modules. It's not convenient to un-zip/re-zip this archive to add custom modules/scripts.    See - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/931
R1392. As a user, I'd like to have _paging_ support so that I can scroll through the list of streams, jobs and containers.     Currently the following error is thrown when we cross >20 rows:    http://localhost:9393/jobs/definitions.json    JSON Response:  {code:xml}  [  	{  		links: [ ],  		logref: "IllegalStateException",  		message: "Not all instances were looked at"  	}  ]  {code}    Stack trace:  {code}  15:51:21,931 ERROR http-nio-9393-exec-9 rest.RestControllerAdvice - Caught exception while handling a request  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Not all instances were looked at    org.springframework.util.Assert.state(Assert.java:385)  {code}
R1393. In BatchJobExecutionsController's list all job executions, for each given job execution, it needs to be evaluated against all the job executions of a given job instance to see if the job execution is restarted.  The rule is: for a given JobInstance, there could be only one job execution that can be in "COMPLETED" state. If the job itself is restartable and if any of the job executions for this job instance are "FAILED" or "STOPPED" then, that job execution can be restarted (based on the client request).  Hence, if the job execution is complete, then it will set the restartable flag to false for all the job executions on a given job instance.
R1394. Currently, the tapping infrastructure uses <modulename>.<index> as part of  the internal name of the channel.  Now that module labels are uniques per stream, we may change to just <modulelabel>  The strategy used to derive the channel name should also be extracted, so that a change to a single piece of code is necessary in the future (currently, there is likely duplication in ChannelNode.resolve() and -I assume- the bus)
R1395. This is a generalization of XD-1702
R1396. See the discussion: https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/messages/20771872
R1397. Acceptance Tests failed on the Rabbit Source and Sink Tests.  The test started failing when XD-1824 was introduced (Support RabbitMQ Cluster in source/sink).  This story added addresses to support rabbit cluster failover.    Currently if a user set --host --port to a remote Rabbit instance, XD will use the default host=localhost and port=5672.  However using --addresses does work.  
R1398. Update documentation related to database migration with the changes from XD-1822
R1399. Currently, TapLifecycleConnectionListener (which implements ZooKeeperConnectionListener) clears(but not closes) the taps (PathChildrenCache) upon ZK `onDisconnect` child event.  Since, `onConnect` child event re-creates the tap PathChildrenCache, the previously created PathChildrenCache is still hanging in there.  I would be better to close the cache upon disconnect.
R1400. Investigate "Job Executions" list page load timing based on number of job executions to load.     The investigation can be of the following steps:    1) Return all the size restrictions to retrieve the number of job executions.  2) Setup 5, 10, 100, 500, 1000 number of job executions and measure the page load timings.    Based on this, we can address the paging support mentioned in XD-1864.
R1401. Note that the documentation for the module options (in particular for http-client) should be autogenerated using the following syntax (see others):  {noformat}  //^processor.http-client  //$processor.http-client  {noformat}    
R1402. The script tests does the following.    {code}  # Filter for good and bad  create_stream 'httpfilter' "http | good: filter --expression=#jsonPath(payload,'\$.entities.hashtags[*].text').contains('good') \  | aftergood: filter --expression=true \  | bad: filter --expression=#jsonPath(payload,'\$.entities.hashtags[*].text').contains('bad') \  | goodandbad: splitter --expression=#jsonPath(payload,'$.id') \  | file --dir=$TEST_DIR" 'true'  {code}
R1403. Port https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/src/test/scripts/gemfire_stream_tests    Need to consider how to start the server, maybe use the jvm fork utilities?  Look into spring-data-gemfire as well.
R1404. The test    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/src/test/scripts/httpbash    is very simple, it doesn't even check the results.  A small change to    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/spring-xd-test-fixtures/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/test/generator/SimpleHttpGenerator.java    so that number of messages to post is specified would be part of this work.
R1405. See    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/src/test/scripts/jdbc_tests#L96    and    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/src/test/scripts/jdbc_tests#L64    The second assert has initializeDb=false and so there are double the number of rows running the job a second time.
R1406. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/src/test/scripts/tweet_tests  use field-value-counter and aggregate-counter.    Should do a simplified version of this so that we can assert values of the field-value-counter and aggregate-counter.
R1407. Also, the approach may not work as expected on windows.
R1408. h2. Narrative As a developer, I need to be able to process the importing of files in parallel via the filejdbc batch job.  h2. Acceptance Criteria # Be able to provide a list of files to the job and have them be read in parallel based on the number of slaves deployed. # Use {{MultiResourcePartitioner}} to create on partition per incoming file.
R1409. https://github.com/spring-projects/gradle-plugins/tree/master/spring-io-plugin is the starting point to introduce the appropriate plugin to check for the correct dependencies.    
R1410. It seems that no option validation (being Spring or jsr 303) is happening anymore at stream creation time.    eg  {noformat}  stream create foo --definition "http --port=bar | log"  {noformat}
R1411. Not all module options are born equal. Some are more important/useful than others, and having the more "expert" ones show up e.g. in TAB completion is very noisy (esp. given how JLine2 currently presents the whole stream definition typed so far when doing completion, as opposed to just the last bit)
R1412. Spring IO Compatibility
R1413. h2. Narrative As a developer, I need to be able to process the importing of files in parallel via the hdfsjdbc batch job.  h2. Acceptance Criteria # Be able to provide a list of files to the job and have them be read in parallel based on the number of slaves deployed. # Use {{MultiResourcePartitioner}} to create on partition per incoming file.
R1414. Addressed for the REST API by XD-1848    The status of a stream, as returned by the REST API (and thus the shell also), may now contain any of the following states:    * deploying (deployment has been initiated)  * deployed (fully deployed based on each of the stream's modules' count properties)  * incomplete (at least 1 of each module, but 1 or more of them not at requested capacity)  * failed (1 or more of the modules does not have even a single instance deployed)  * undeployed (intentionally undeployed, or created but not yet deployed)  
R1415. Use external JVM launch support provided by the Oracle Tools framework (https://java.net/projects/oracletools).
R1416. See https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-1684    Requires update to gradle 2.1
R1417. This should include some guidance on setting rabbit message bus paramters relating to prefetch and concurrency.    It should also discuss the 'bypass' functionality - or reference another section that covers it.    We should probably include how to scale out http sources, e.g. the need to use a load balancer.
R1418. If a sink fails for whatever reason, will it be possible to handle it? Say by sending the payload to an error queue for later processing when a JDBC or Mongo sink fails due to a database connectivity loss? Or the modules are designed by certain principles / contracts not to be meant to handle such failures?

R1423. There are couple of places where jquery is being used in the admin UI and those are for some DOM manipulations.  I believe these can certainly be replaced with the use of angular directive or custom functions and thereby we can remove jQuery dependency in the app.
R1424. see https://github.com/spring-projects/gradle-plugins/blob/master/propdeps-plugin/README.md    This would allow us to reduce the distribution size further maybe
R1425. In order to minimize code duplication - Create an AngularJS directive to render deployment statuses. We could even color code the various statuses.  We should also create a 2nd directive for the status-help-popover. We should consider to possibly use the Angular Bootstrap UI popover support.
R1426. When deploying a definition with a container match criteria specified, and no container could be selected - the logging is ambiguous and should mention the affected module:    {code}  11:58:24,089  WARN DeploymentSupervisorCacheListener-0 cluster.DefaultContainerMatcher - No currently available containers match criteria 'somecriteria'  {code}
R1427. As a minimum we need some common polling strategy on the client side to detect status changes of job + streams etc. (E.g. during deployment of streams/jobs)    Ideally, I would like to have this addressed on the server-side as well. It would be nice if we could propagate events between, containers and admin-server that would inform about any changes in the system. We could then use those to notify connected UI clients.
R1428. When the job is in "deploying" state, until we decide whether the job is actually "deployed" or "failed"/"incomplete", there is no way to know if it is fine to launch/schedule (though the launching requests are going to go to the job launch request queue).   We could either disable both "deploy"/"undeploy" until the state changes from "deploying"?
R1429. Now that the bus supports retry it is no longer necessary to have the retry advice in the TCP Sink.

R1431. I am using Spring XD to ingest the data into Pivotal HD.My source is log files which is coming from logstash through Rabbitmq. I could able to ingest the log files in HDFS (by using Rabbitmq source and HDFS sink)  However when i try to ingest the data directly into Hawq by using JDBC sink,it's not working. Shall we directly load Rabbitmq source into any databases like Hawq?      stream create --name pivotalqueue --definition "rabbit --host=<my host name>   | jdbc   --columns='colum list'"      ---Not working    I configured jdbc in jdbc.properties. There was no issue with jdbc configuration(because i tested this with simple tail source it's working and load the data into HAWQ.  stream create --name pivotalqueue --definition "tail --name=/tmp/xd/output/test.out   | jdbc  --columns='columns list'"  )  
R1432. FtpHdfsTest was added in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1005 but excluded since it will require some changes to run on ec2, including setting up an ftpServer on ec2 with appropriate security, etc.
R1433. In case of the deployment property module count for a specific module in a stream/job is zero, the stream/job deployment status is calculated as "zero" even though the modules are deployed to all matching containers.  Currently, the DefaultStateCalculator's 'calculate' method doesn't check if the expected count is zero.  Also, we would need all the matching containers to determine the same module is deployed to all the matching containers (in case of module count = 0)
R1434. Hadoop 2.4.1 is now a stable release and we should add support for running against it
R1435. Hi    If I create a hdfs stream as proposed in the documentation I get some errors.    Example:  stream create --name xxx --definition "http --port=8000 | hdfs --rollover=10"   stream deploy --name xxx    The exception:  Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: ...spring-xd-1.0.0.M7/config/hadoop.properties (No such file or directory)    java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method)    There is a folder /spring-xd-1.0.0.M7/xd/config but no folder /spring-xd-1.0.0.M7/config  when I copied the file from /xd/config to /config it worked fine.
R1436. Need to update the examples in the TypeConversion doc, re spring social Tweet which is no longer used.
R1437. XD currently has rabbit source and sink but only a source for JMS.    Add a JMS sink - the provider infrastructure should be configured in a similar manner to the source ({{--provider}}).    Other properties needed:   {code}  destinationName  destinationExpression  sessionTransacted  deliveryPersistent*  pubSubDomain  priority*  timeToLive*  {code}    * if any of these properties are set we need to coerce the {{explicit-qos-enabled}} to be {{true}}  
R1438. To bring in line with the rest of default date-formats, change the date format to yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss in TriggerSourceOptionsMetadata
R1439. Currently specified Cron Expressions are executed in the Container's default TimeZone. In *Trigger.xml* we specify:  {code} 	<beans profile="use-cron"> 		<int:inbound-channel-adapter channel="output" 			auto-startup="false" expression="'${payload}'"> 			<int:poller cron="${cron}" /> 		</int:inbound-channel-adapter> 	</beans> {code}  This translates in *org.springframework.integration.config.xml.PollerParser* to  {code} BeanDefinitionBuilder builder = BeanDefinitionBuilder.genericBeanDefinition(CronTrigger.class); builder.addConstructorArgValue(cronAttribute) {code}  Which will call *org.springframework.scheduling.support.CronTrigger*:  {code} 	/** 	 * Build a {@link CronTrigger} from the pattern provided in the default time zone. 	 * @param cronExpression a space-separated list of time fields, 	 * following cron expression conventions 	 */ 	public CronTrigger(String cronExpression) { 		this.sequenceGenerator = new CronSequenceGenerator(cronExpression); 	} {code}  "Build a {@link CronTrigger} from the pattern provided in the *default time zone*."  We need to pass-in a timezone. *Should cron expressions as part of an XD *Definition* have a TimeZone parameter?* When creating the stream via the UI or the Shell the timezone can be inferred (if not specified) but should be mandatory for the REST API, meaning being passed in as a mandatory parameter (OR alternatively, if not passed in we assume the Cron expression is specified for UTC).  That way we could ensure that a (Stream/Job) Definition is globally valid.
R1440. Ideally we could try out best if there was a date that didn't have the TZD format on it: e.g. figure what the local time zone is (AdminUI or Shell) and figure out if we are ahead/behind UTC.  So * "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm"  would say 'try to use local time zone' * "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ" would be UTC * "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm+4:00" would be '4 hrs ahead of UTC  However, we need to ultimately submit an ISO compliant time to the XD server.  The UI/shell should try to be as accommodating as possible...e.g postel's law: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle  Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.

R1443. Have a REST endpoint that would run validation of a definition (without actually attempting the creation, let alone deployment) and return a structured representation of validation errors.  This to benefit the web ui
R1444. Previously, the scripts all looked for the logging configuration in $XD_HOME/config (or %XD_HOME%/config). This caused issues because it meant that if you moved all of the configuration and overrode $XD_CONFIG_LOCATION (or %XD_CONFIG_LOCATION%), the logging configuration changes would not be found in the new location. This change updates the scripts to look for logging configuration in $XD_CONFIG_LOCATION (or %XD_CONFIG_LOCATION%).

R1470. When the leadership election happens, the new deployment supervisor's container listener tries to deploy unallocated modules (via ArrivingContainerModuleRedeployer) into existing container that has the modules of the same type on a given stream/job already deployed.  Currently, on a given stream/job we don't allow more than one deployment of the same module type and there by avoiding any conflicting properties for the given module type. 
R1471. The 'module info' command renders text that is pretty much unreadable on a reasonably sized screen. See attached screen shot. Also all the jdbc pool settings are mixed in with module settings making for a confusing list of options. What the heck does 'fairQueue' have to do with filejdbc jobs?
R1472. The acceptance tests interrogate the XD-Admin for the containers that are available.  When on EC2 the admin only returns the internal EC2 addresses without the associated suffix of .ec2.internal or .compute-1.internal.     [Defect] The acceptance tests only handled the most common suffix of .ec2.internal.  Thus some CI Acceptance tests will fail because, because the container's IPs were not properly mapped.  Thus the acceptance tests should map internal to external IP without regard to the suffixes EC2 issues.  FYI EC2 issues addresses in 2 different formats: ip-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.ec2.internal or domU-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX.compute-1.internal.  The code only able to handle ip-XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX.ec2.internal.

R1477. HdfsTest uses the following stream to test the hdfs sink.  trigger --payload='foobar' | hdfs.  In the test failure, the test reported that no file was created on the hdfs.    I'm wondering if the trigger fired before the hdfs was fully deployed.   I would say that we set the phase to the maximum, but the problem is that by default it is MAX_INT.  Thoughts?
R1478. Acceptance tests check the number of "sends" for each module after a single event is triggered.  This should entail that each module in the stream should have a send count of "1".   Sporadically this test will fail on a sink, where the send count will be 2.

R1479. When a validation error occurs in the UI, it is displayed as a small box then fades away.  If it is a larger form or a less specific error, the user may not catch everything before it fades away.  We should display the error in a way that they can refer to as they are fixing it.
R1480. h3.  Narrative  As a developer, I need to be able to create a Spring XD job module that consists of a job orchestrating the execution of other Spring Batch jobs using the Spring Batch Job Step (see section 5.3.6 here: http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/html/configureStep.html) within the same module definition.    h3.  Acceptance Criteria  # Define the "contract" for a job module  ## Currently the contract consists of a single job definition within the assembled {{ApplicationContext}} ({{context.getBean(Job.class)}}).  ## The new version will need to document what job definition within the assembled {{ApplicationContext}} should be run as the entry point.  I'm assuming it would be by id ({{context.getBean("job")}} for example) of the job but am open to other options.  # A custom job module that orchestrates multiple Spring Batch jobs via Job steps should be able to be deployed and executed as a single Spring XD module.  ## Spring XD launches the job that conforms to the previously defined "contract".  ## Spring Batch manages the execution of the child jobs.  # The existing OOTB jobs should work under the new "contract".    h3.  Assumptions  # The UI should "just work" in that child jobs update the job repository independently so no updates should be needed for an MVP of this functionality.  # *This will be a breaking change for users that have developed custom job modules.*    h3.  Out of Scope  # Execution of child jobs that are remote (deployed on another node / {{ApplicationContext}}).  # Dynamically assembling jobs via the shell's DSL or the UI.  
R1481. In dev mode I created a twitter stream, rebuilt the server, and then wanted to destroy it.  My new install didn't have any twitter keys as I was also not using XD_CONFIG_LOCATION.  xd:>stream destroy --name tweets  Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Error with option(s) for module twitterstream of type source:     consumerKey: You must provide a 'consumerKey' token to use this module.     consumerSecret: You must provide a 'consumerSecret' token to use this module.   I should be able to destroy a stream w/o having to supply values for PPCs.
R1482. The [Back] button is at lower left of the page which requires scrolling all the way to the bottom - could we move it to top right? Would make clicking back and forth for job executions much easier.

R1485. Many attributes in Mixins use hard coded values instead of using property placeholders.      JdbcConnectionMixin, JdbcConnectionPoolMixin, MqttConnectionMixin...
R1486. The log sink is not writing information to the log.  Not the solution but, when log4j.rootLogger is set to INFO, the log sink information is written to the log.  
R1487. When the admin, container and singlenode servers start, the "Started ..Application" log message is displayed everytime the spring application is created.  We should only log when the server is started eventually.
R1488. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/commit/db66aa2a329a6fc7ef89a340dd4d562fa70d14a4 introduces org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-logging-log4j which is not covered by platform. Yet, we should lookup the version to use from other tomcat artifacts, using some gradle magic

R1490. A possible approach is to set a configurable wait period when the first container arrives. If another container arrives during the wait period, reset the clock. When the wait period expires, start deploying modules. 
R1491. Trying to deploy the hashtagcount batch sample [1] to Hadoop 2.4.1 or Hortonworks HDP 2.1 fails with an IllegalAccessError exception.    Looks like a Guava versioning issue - Swapping out guava-17.0.jar for guava-11.0.2.jar in the xd/lib directory solves it.    Mark P suggested we try 16.0.1 which is what Curator uses and that seems to work as well.

R1493. Create a test specific to for the trigger source instead of it being tested with other Acceptance tests.
R1494. To remain consistent across all (processor, sink, job) tests, http should be used as the source.

R1498. I am converting a Spring XD Sample (Batch notifications) from copying jars to (old way)    {code}  $XD_HOME/lib  {code}    To rather copy the module jar to (new preferred way)    {code}  $XD_HOME/modules/job/payment-import/lib  {code}    By doing so, I hit a classloader issue. Custom classes and resources are loaded in Spring XD using *org.springframework.xd.module.support.ParentLastURLClassLoader*.    However, the sample is initializing custom bean definitions and one of those creates a new *DataSource* using the *EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder*. This class however, under the hood, uses the *Default* class loader to load SQL scripts:    {code}  	public DefaultResourceLoader() {  		this.classLoader = ClassUtils.getDefaultClassLoader();  	}  {code}    Therefore, the SQL scripts are NOT FOUND.    *Possible Solution*    A possible solution seems to be for *ParentLastURLClassLoader* to set itself as the context ClassLoader for the current thread:    {code}  	public ParentLastURLClassLoader(URL[] classpath, ClassLoader parent) {  		...  		Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(this);  		...  	}  {code}
R1499. For the Job execution list, the step execution count for each job execution is always set to zero.    For a single job execution display command, the step execution count is set correctly.
R1500. After clicking 'deploy' on the definitions page, the 'deploy' button is deactivated and message says:    "An error occurred.

R1501. The AggregateCounterTests were created to satisfy XD-1462, but currently they only have a couple tests to validate the time field processing. More comprehensive tests need to be added (including the testing of the Redis-based implementation in addition to in-memory).    For more info, see the comment here:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1087#issuecomment-49638189
R1502. The jars     jersey-test-framework-core-1.9.jar   jersey-test-framework-grizzly2-1.9.jar    are incorrectly classified as compile time deps in hadoop vs. testCompile.    
R1503. see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-afterburner
R1504. The REST API for DSL completion currently returns a List<String>.  This prevents future backwards compatible extension. Should change to List<Completion> where Completion has e.g. a "text" property.
R1505. Determine a better package name for the following packages once we have a common model that applies to both stream/job:  `org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream`   `org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.zookeeper`  
R1506. In cases where the deployment requires jars that can not be included with the distribution, the user should be able to pull a jar from a http site and place it in lib/xd.      The use case is that when we removed the mysql jar from the distribution, the CI tests could not start the XD instances on EC2 without it.  It was suggested that we use the postgresql instead, but decided to continue the use of mysql for acceptance tests.

R1509. Propose the following changes to our logging:  * Create unique file names by including the pid in the file name - this allows each process (in particular containers) to maintain its own log file  * Use DailyRollingFileAppender to roll files over on a daily basis 
R1510. Introduced by XD-2006, admin and container logs will have a pid suffix appended to their filename.  The acceptance tests will have to identify the PID for the admin server and the container servers deployed in the cluster and then append the pid value to the filename contained in the xd_container_log_dir.
R1511. https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Central+Sync+Requirements    has a list of requirements.  This also means that https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-1509 is critical to fix.
R1512. Container's module deployer (org.springframework.xd.dirt.module.ModuleDeployer) has some unused code and container-server.xml has listeners.xml which is no longer used. Also, all the extension code is moved to SharedContextConfiguration.
R1513. When hdfsmongodb was written Spring Batch did not have a MongoItemWriter available, so Mark wrote one for XD.  The hdfsmongodb module now needs to be use Spring Batches MongoItemWriter.
R1514. Based on this change, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/commit/87b97a0b4651f862e8a639697745ad232bb42e6a The gradle build scripts now refer to two different places to check for the list of hadoop distro sub projects. We can simplify this to make it available in one place so that maintenance will be easier.
R1515. The condition that leads to this exception does not seem like it would ever occur, namely the BPP processing a job deployment for a job that was already deployed to the same container.
R1516. Currently, end-to-end tests of Spring XD UI will not run, as protractor relies on a non-existing chromedriver.exe file.    Either the configuration has to be removed from the Gruntfile or the necessary dependencies should be there.

R1518. When I start xd-singlenode for instance, I would expect to see http://localhost:9393/admin-ui listed in the logs.
R1519. The reference pdf doc has some of the images not aligned well within the document.    For the latest doc from snapshot build, please refer here:    http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot-local/org/springframework/xd/spring-xd/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/
R1520. 1)StreamUtils should be removed (in that static util classes are frowned upon) and its functionality should be placed in the appropriate classes.   2) XdEnvironment - Many classes use this to obtain Environment variables.  The environment variables should be obtained via @Value in the classes that they are required. Only those values that require special setup ssh private key, Connection factories should remain in XdEnvironment. 
R1521. Replace the execution of JPS to retrieve PID for the containers in the acceptance tests with runtimeOperations().listRuntimeContainers().  
R1522. Please refer to: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/1119

R1526. Need a re-write of the configuration files for YARN deployments
R1527. If the XD admin server lets tomcat chooses random http port by setting PORT or server.port to '0', the XD config logging and admin server context id still points to port zero as these are set before tomcat assigns the available random port.    We also need to persist the admin servers' ports into ZK so that this repo can be accessed by the client.
R1528. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Creating-a-Job-Item-Processor    should be very brief introduction to this topic, before linking to relevant spring batch documentation.
R1529. There are a few places in the doc we can reference regarding overall lifecycle of jobs but this should provide a basic recipe for a single step job.    The focus should be on creating a job item processor.    In particular how List<Message<Tuple>> as the payload.    this should link back to a new section in the aggregator that also mentions List<Message<Tuple>>    Change title from  Creating a Job Item Processor to Creating a Job Module
R1530. Spring 4.0 provides a UUID generator (used by default in SI) that should be used instead of the com.eaoi.uuid library in the xd-tuple library
R1531. As a temporary work around to fix XD-1935, make producible media type to 'application/json' for Job executions GET request endpoints.
R1532. Removed  various TODO comments in code and put here for proper triage.    DefaultTuple    * Error handling.  When delegating to the conversion service, the ConversionFailedException does not have the context of which key caused the failure.  Need to wrap ConversionFailedException with IllegalArgumentException and add that context back in.  (see method convert)   * Ctor visibility.  Consider making ctor final and package protect the ctor so as to always use TupleBuilder   * check for no duplicate values when initializing names/values list    tuple.  * top level methods to add.      String getComponentName... somethign that would indicate which stream or job this tuple is being processed in....    * TupleFieldSetMapper    Only one date format?    * JsonStringtoTupleConverter/JsonNodetoTupleConverter   * do we want to not map id and timestamp (believe the answer is don't map, preserve original)    
R1533. Noticed a few issues while reviewing the documentation    * The sidebar for TOC is no longer there :(  That was really nice.  * Somehow the 'Using-MQTT-on-XD' section is giving an error.    {quote}  asciidoctor: WARNING: index.adoc: line 167: invalid style for paragraph: appendix  asciidoctor: WARNING: index.adoc: line 169: include file not found: /data/projects/spring-xd/build/asciidoc/guide/Using-MQTT-on-XD.asciidoc  :distZip  {quote}    but I don't notice anything different between that appendix and the others in index.adoc.      
R1534. The   #ConnectionPoolSettings    define this in the beginning -     {code}  #spring:  #  datasource:  {code}    uncommenting this will override/invalidate any changes made earlier in the section since it defines spring:datasource again    should either be removed or in separate section
R1535. tried local xd-admin/xd-container after setting    {code}  export XD_MODULE_CONFIG_LOCATION=file:./spring-xd-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-yarn/config/  {code}    have my twitter stuff in modules.yml in that directory but not picked up by the twitterstream module    Also not working for me deploying on YARN, this used to work at some point, not sure how long ago I actually tested this part - M6/M7?    The setting used for YARN deployment:    {code}  -Dxd.module.config.location: "file:./"  {code}
R1536. With HealthIndicatorAutoConfiguration, the health endpoint shows up:    {"status":"DOWN","healthIndicator":{"status":"UP"},"rabbit":{"status":"DOWN","error":"org.springframework.amqp.AmqpConnectException: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused"},"redis":{"status":"UP","version":"2.8.9"},"mongo":{"status":"DOWN","error":"org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException: Timed out while waiting to connect after 3894 ms; nested exception is com.mongodb.MongoTimeoutException: Timed out while waiting to connect after 3894 ms"},"db":{"status":"UP","database":"HSQL Database Engine","hello":1}}    We can only use vanilla health indicator, since other status may not be relevant.
R1537. Maybe only have it run after the publish build instead of triggering builds directly from jdk6->7->8.
R1538. It would be good to log the server, module config locations and names when the admin, container, singlenode servers startup.
R1539. https://github.com/spring-projects/gradle-plugins/tree/master/spring-io-plugin Allows us to create a springIoCheck that will verify the status of XD's dependencies as it stands with SpringIO.    We would need to add the dependencies as show in the document.  But we would need to add the:  if (project.hasProperty('platformVersion')) {      ...     } code segment to the configure(javaProjects).
R1540. Part of the issue is likely with the build script https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/build.gradle#L1859  We should also add a link checker to the CI build.
R1541. * Update XD-EC2 configs to Pull from 1.0.1 Repo * Update XD-EC2 Configs to use spring-xd-1.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT dir  * Update test configs XD_HOME to spring-xd-1.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT instead of spring-xd-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
R1542. As a user, I'd like to have the option to use the _SFTP_ source module so that I can access, transfer, and mange files over any reliable data streams.    *Reference:*  [Spring Integration SFTP Adapter|http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/sftp.html]    Need to consider the infrastructure for testing.

R1544. I have a stream that watch output of multi file in a directory, process data and put it to HDFS. Here is my stream creat command:  stream create --name fileHdfs --definition "file --dir=/var/log/supervisor/ --pattern=tracker.out-*.log --outputType=text/plain | logHdfsTransformer | hdfs --fsUri=hdfs://192.168.1.115:8020 --directory=/data/log/appsync --fileName=log --partitionPath=path(dateFormat('yyyy/MM/dd'))" --deploy  Problem is source:file module send all data read from file to log processing module instead of one line each turn, becase of that, payload string have millions of char, i can't process it. Ex:  --- PAYLOAD LENGTH---- 9511284  Please tell me how to read line by line when use source:file module, thanks !!!
R1545. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25072967/spring-xd-redis-message-bus-removing-headers-from-the-message/25081538#25081538    Currently, you have to modify {{redis-bus.xml}} in the dirt jar.
R1546. Do you have plans to support Spark? In version 1.0 GA, Spring XD has supported Hadoop, But it has not supported the brand new big data calculation platform Spark. do you have plans to support Spark in the future?
R1547. Singlenode fails to start using spring-xd-dirt-1.0.0.RELEASE.jar see https://github.com/dturanski/xd-test  The root cause of the error:  java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.ServletContext.addServlet(Ljava/lang/String;Ljavax/servlet/Servlet;)Ljavax/servlet/ServletRegistration$Dynamic;  Indicating an incompatible servlet version is being pulled in by default.
R1548. I have not tested this on M7 but I believe it is the case with latest release as well.    Stream definition 1:  stream create logIngestion --definition "rabbit --queues=demo --host=<rabbitmq-broker> | script --location=linemerge.groovy | hdfs --rollover=10M --idleTimeout=10000 --fileUuid=true --directory=/data/loganalysis --partitionPath=path(payload.split('\u0001')[1],dateFormat('yyyy/MM/dd/HH',payload.split('\u0001')[0],'yyyyMMddHHmmss'))"    we noticed this was causing writes to be slower    Stream definition 2:  stream create logIngestion --definition "rabbit --queues=demo --host=<rabbitmq-broker> | script --location=linemerge.groovy | hdfs --rollover=10M --idleTimeout=10000 --fileUuid=true --directory=/data/loganalysis "    but this definition caused the writes to be much faster.    Please note this was just a one time test I did and not reproduced multiple times.     Janne also seems to have reproduced this in another use case.    Thanks  Girish
R1549. Download zipped Job Modules from a HTTP Site and deploy them to modules on the admin & containers, before container is started.
R1550. As an user, I'd like to have OOTB source modules to integrate with various data sources to ingest data using Spring XD.   Note: The OOTB support, however, is limited to currently available Spring Integration adapters.   Acceptance Criteria: - User should be able to list the 'new source' through DSL commands  - User should be able to optionally choose the "new source" adapters for stream creation using XD shell - User should see appropriate error messages if the required attributes are missing while creating a stream with the 'new source' module - After successful stream creation with the 'new source' module, the definition should be included in stream listing - REST endpoints should include 'new source' definitions - Data ingested using the 'new source' should be validated for accurateness - Appropriate error/exception message needs logged if there's any problem ingesting data using 'new source' module     
R1551. As an user, I'd like to have OOTB sink modules to integrate with various data sources to egest data using Spring XD.   Note: The OOTB support, however, is limited to currently available Spring Integration adapters.  Acceptance Criteria: - User should be able to list the 'new sink' through DSL commands  - User should be able to optionally choose the "new sink" adapters for stream creation using XD shell - User should see appropriate error messages if the required attributes are missing while creating a stream with the 'new sink' module - After successful stream creation with the 'new sink' module, the definition should be included in stream listing - REST endpoints should include 'new sink' definitions - Data ingested into 'new sink' should be validated for accurateness - Appropriate error/exception message needs logged if there's any problem ingesting data into 'new sink' module
R1552. As an user, I'd like to have the ability to setup infrastructure to develop/enhance UI functionality.  This is including but not limited to: - UI designs (mockup's) - Unit testing - CI - JS 'minification'  
R1553. As a user, I should be able to leverage native _ElasticSearch_ sink so that I can aggregate, search and analyze data insights in real-time.
R1554. We are currently facing issues with Travis. Determine the root cause, isolate the bottleneck, and resolve the issues.
R1555. The goal is to optimize the build process and at the same time validate the feature capabilities as quickly as we can. Investigate the long running tests. Look for long timeout window declarations. 
R1556. Need to add a retry to the createDataFileOnRemote machine, because the creation of the test file on the remote machine fails from time to time. Usually related to network issues. 
R1557. As an user, I'd like to have a native _JDBC_ source module to ingest data directly from various databases. 
R1558. As an user, I'd like to have the ability to ingest data into _Redis_ sink.
R1559. Non-functional requirements such as reliability, availability, scalability, and performance needs measured and validated.   Acceptance criteria: - Throughput: Measure the messaging infrastructure (broker/bus) capabilities in terms of messages consumed/sec. Compute the data ingestion rate/sec.  - HA/Scalability: Measure of DIRT architecture capabilities through linear increase/decrease/destroy xd-containers and xd-admins along with payload variations.  - Durability: Measure linear variations on payload with baseline DIRT infrastructure to compute end-to-end durability. 
R1560. Use a baseline DIRT infrastructure to measure throughput, HA and scalability for various payload sizes.    Depends on testing infrastructure setup, configuration and availability.
R1561. Have to update the code because of deprecation and to get ready for 2.0.
R1562. Update  to replace deprecated code.
R1563. Tests that use verifySendCounts to validate whether data was sent to all the modules in a stream occasionally fail.  This is because, sometimes it takes 2 or more sends to get the data transmitted between modules.  With the current test structure this is considered a failure.  Is this the correct behavior?
R1564. This will in turn allow us to get rid of the custom logic for handling crossref links between documents
R1565. In some scenarios like when performing exploratory data-analysis on streaming data one often create a stream, keep it running for some time (or until some condition is met) and then stop the stream and start to investigate the collected data.  It would be cool to be able to specify some undeploy condition, like e.g. a timeout after x minutes, no. of events collected, a specific counter past a given threshold, file-size greater then x etc.
R1566. The http source does not provide debug logging to see information such as http headers and requests, in particular if a non OK response is returned.    I updated the log4j config for org.jboss.netty but it had no effect.  I suspect this is due to the need to configure the netty logging system via InternalLoggerFactory.setDefaultFactory(new Log4JLoggerFactory()).    
R1567. Remove   {noformat}  		filter { line ->  			// TODO: refine regex to only match local documents  			def match = (line =~ /link:(.*?)#(.*?)\[(.*?)\]/)  			if (match) match.replaceAll('xref:$2[$3]') else line  		}    {noformat}    and replace link:Foo#bar by xref:Foo#bar    
R1568. split out build.gradle into multiple files.
R1569. xd-shell by default will try to connect to the admin node in the same host. You need to run "admin config server" to specify the URI where the admin node is - every time you run xd-shell.   xd-shell should have a command line argument "--adminUri" so that the user can invoke the xd-shell passing the Admin Node Uri as an argument when running the shell and then be able to use xd-shell in interactive mode without having to run "admin config server" every time.     
R1570.

R1572. I'd be very pratical if the mail sink has the ability to send files as attachment. I.e. add the attribute "attachment-filename" to header-enricher.
R1573. Problem using twittersearch when the system where the XD container is running has two network interfaces.  With the following config:  eth0      local network, resolves `hostname`  eth1      internet network  I get an error deploying the stream:  {code} 12:08:22,965  WARN twitterSource-1-1 client.RestTemplate - GET request for "https://stream.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/sample.json" resulted in 401 (Authorization Required); invoking error handler 12:08:22,972 ERROR twitterSource-1-1 twitter.TwitterStreamChannelAdapter - Twitter authentication failed: 401 Authorization Required {code}  If I flip the network interfaces to be:  eth0      internet network, resolves `hostname` eth1      local network    then it seems to work. 
R1574. Provide for retry and/or dead-lettering for the rabbit source (similar to the rabbit message bus).

R1578. h3.  Narrative As a developer, I need to be able to configure a partitioned job's grid size so that the correct number of partitions are created (the current code is hard coded to 1 for the grid size).  h3.  Acceptance Criteria # Expose the gridSize attribute of the {{MessageChannelPartitionHandler}} as an option.  h3.  Assumptions # Existing OOTB jobs should not be impacted by this given they don't use the grid size. 
R1579. h1. Summary  User wants the ability to deploy an ec2 cluster where the admin & containers use a pre existing ZK ensemble, Rabbit and redis instance that are deployed on different machines.   h2. Current functionality Currently spring-xd-ec2 sets up its containers & admin server to use a ZK, rabbit and redis that are provisioned and collocated with the admin server.    h2. Detail The following properties will be added to the spring-xd-ec2.properties # *spring_zk_client_connect* - contains a comma delimited list of zk hosts:ports for a ensemble.  The application will check to see if the port is open on at least of the servers in the list, if not deployment will fail.  Default is adminServer_host:2181. # *spring_rabbitmq_addresses* - contains a comma delimited list of hosts:ports for a rabbit cluster.  The application will check to see if the port is open on at least of the servers in the list, if not deployment will fail.  Default is adminServer_host:5672. # *spring_redis* - contains a host:port for a redis instance. The application will check to see if the port is open , if not deployment will fail.  Default is adminServer_host:5672. # *ec2_zone* - user can specify the zone to which the containers and admin will be deployed.  If not present AWS will decide which zone to deploy the cluster.
R1580. h1. Run Acceptance tests on the following  deployments.      h2. Slow Network  Simulate slow network by deploying a XD cluster where the ZK Ensemble is only available via WAN.      h2. Network packet loss  Simulate cases where a network packets can be lost.    
R1581. Design Spike: Investigate best approach to encrypt data pipeline. Consider all moving parts within the topology including the scenarios where data is at rest and as well as in transit. 
R1582. As an Ops, I'd like to setup security for the ZK nodes, so I could restrict access to zNodes to the right users/apps. 
R1583. As a developer, I'd like to have the option of extending the Trigger abstraction so that I can implement my own trigger.       
R1584. As a user, I'd like to have guidance to create custom modules so that I can align the development practices with recommended approach.     11/20: Update: Scope of this task is to create an example to demonstrate and document the capability.
R1585. Design Spike: Investigate various approaches to bootstrap custom modules. Can Spring Boot be leveraged? Starter POM?
R1586. Currently, org.springframework.xd.dirt.cluster.Container has name and attributes (container attributes). This can be enhanced to include all the deployed modules, number of deployed modules and any more useful info. and can subsequently be used to get a detailed runtime container info.
R1587. Currently, there is a "stream list"/"job list" which shows the status of a given stream/job along with the DSL. and, there is "runtime modules" which shows all the deployed modules with their container info.    We need a better REST endpoint that gives all the deployed modules for a given stream/job along with the status.
R1588. We need a visual representation of the XD cluster with runtime container and deployed modules.
R1589. Admin UI currently allows job to be deployed with deployment properties, we need similar way to deploy stream with the deployment properties (module count, container matching criteria).
R1590. For a given stream/job, we need a visual representation of the stream/job with any deployed modules.
R1591. When the container starts up, it has a random http port for management configurations. If the container has management port enabled, then we can store it as container attribute. If the admin can reach out to the container on that port, then we can provide an option to shutdown container from the admin server.
R1592. Kafka lends itself well as a message bus, and kafka partitioning maps to MB partitioning.    Implement KafkaMessageBus and supporting classes and UT/IT.
R1593. If a job is deployed an the singlenode job is canceled, the job name cannot neither be reused nor destroyed. See screenshots. 
R1594. XD Module configured for component scanning classes (or methods?) annotated with @Source, (consider @Processor, and @Sink as well) and simply provide the POJOs and dependent jars in the module /lib directory. Custom processor is fairly straightforward currently, but still requires an XML module definition to wire up the POJO as a service activator or transformer to the input and output channel. A service activator works for a POJO backed sink. Writing a source that is not backed by an existing inbound channel adapter is a bit more involved and requires more than basic familiarity with SI. It should be possible for XD to automatically create a polling source by wiring a Java method to an inbound adapter configured with a poller. Ideally, we would require no XML, even to enable component scanning- this will require some changes to the module registry/module initializer.
R1595. As a user, I'd like to have the option to write into _Kafka_ sink so that I can publish mass data into Kafka broker.
R1596. As a result of fixing XD-2015 we still cannot execute:  {code} grunt test:e2e {code}  Basically running the tests AND the server together in one process fails. We see the following error: *Fatal error: socket hang up*.  If we separate the protractor execution into 2 separate steps, the tests pass:  {code} grunt serve (one console window) grunt protractor:run (second console window) {code}  In the *grunt serve* window, you can still observe *Fatal error: socket hang up* being printed out but the tests execute successfully.   
R1597. Currently, custom SI property accessors are registered by a plugin (org.springframework.xd.dirt.plugins.SpelPropertyAccessorPlugin) and are not visible by the bus.    I believe they should be.    This may just be a matter of moving them around.
R1598. As a user, I'd like to have the ability to visually explore XD's cluster view so that I'm aware where the components are deployed and how they are connected within the topology. 
R1599. Currently, the aggregate counter only adds +1 to the individual values, even though support is there to add any increment.    This ticket is about surfacing a SpEL expression on the message to choose the increment
R1600. It would be nice if the admin ui would sort the streams in such a way that the taps that are created for a particular stream are somehow placed UNDER the tapped stream... {code} Stream A ...  +-Tap A.foo ...  +-Tap A.bar ... {code}  Same goes for the list command in the XD-Shell
R1601. The resulting definition starts with --makeUnique=true even if the MakeUnique checkbox is unchecked. I can check and uncheck the box and the --make unique parameter isn't included. Since the default for this parameter is true the end result is the same. There doesn't seem to be a way to set --makeUnique=false.
R1602. [Current Behavior] Currently XD-EC2 downloads an XD zip file from the location specified by the xd-dist-url after verifying that the file is accessible..   
R1603. There is a class-loader issue when defining JDBC driver/pool dataSource for a custom job module. If I use the Tomcat DataSource it pulls the driver classes from /xd/lib, but if I use a DataSource class that's not loaded by the XD runtime like SimpleDriverDataSource then it pulls the jdbc driver jars from my job module's lib directory which I was expecting since the JDBC drivers I'm using are not delivered as part of XD.   The whole class-loading scheme for custom modules needs either better documentation or improvement. Currently it's difficult to tell where classes will be loaded from and what classes are available on the server classpath and which classes have already been loaded. 
R1604. Currently the application allows AWS select which zone in the region to create an instance.
R1605. curl http://localhost:9393/metrics/aggregate-counters/smartgrid_h_28_load_predicted\?resolution\=minute\&from\=2013-09-01T12:55:00.000Z\&to\=2013-09-01T13:00:00.000Z     would return 0 as the last bucket, while    curl http://localhost:9393/metrics/aggregate-counters/smartgrid_h_28_load_predicted\?resolution\=minute\&from\=2013-09-01T12:55:00.000Z\&to\=2013-09-01T13:05:00.000Z    would correctly return the value for 13:00:00
R1606. A job gets stuck in "deploying" state when a job is deployed when there are no containers available.  When a container is started after this event, the job doesn't automatically start because of the job is stuck in the "deploying" state instead of the "failed" state.      Refer to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/193088dc164c73e07d7b4509de22241b28bf42b3/spring-xd-dirt/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/dirt/server/JobDeploymentListener.java    Update of the status in Zookeeper is inside the NoContainerException catch block.    This works correctly for streams.
R1607. Would be nice to have a sink for REST resources.  Might be configurable with an endpoint URI. Basic auth details would be a nice to have too.  Would perform a POST to the endpoint passing the payload.
R1608. When using redis as transport bus there is a problem when using many streams and taps. Basically the maxTotal parameter of org.apache.commons.pool2.GenericObjectPool default is 8. After some streams are deployed it starts to occur concurrency problems hence the number of inbound redis channel adapters is larger than that number.    A more detailed explanation is in stackoverflow:    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25851660/spring-xd-very-poor-performance-when-using-redis-as-transport
R1609. Create processor and sink modules that can execute a shell command using stdin and stdout to stream data.
R1610. As a user, I'd like to have the option to enable HTTPS so that I can access XD's Admin server [endpoints|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/REST-API#xd-resources] over secured communication.    Technical Implementation:    This functionality is available in Spring Boot 1.2.0 M1 and has been backported into the 1.1.x branch to be released under Spring 1.1.7.  We can test against 1.1.7 SNAPSHOT.    Working through the way to update the build file to pick up a new version of boot is a bit tricky :(
R1611. As a user, I'd like to have the option to provide file based security configurations so that I can access the endpoints in a secured manner.    Ideally, all the listed *endpoints* (http://localhost:9393/) needs to be encapsulated within file based security layer.    Reference:  [Securing Web App|https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/]
R1612. As a user, I'd like to have the option to provide LDAP based security configurations so that I can access the endpoints in a secured manner.    Ideally, all the listed *endpoints* (http://localhost:9393/) needs to be encapsulated within LDAP based security layer.    Reference:  [Authentication using LDAP|https://spring.io/guides/gs/authenticating-ldap/]
R1613. As a user, I'd like to have the option to configure default access control for endpoints so that I can grant access by _Admin_ or _Viewer_ roles.
R1614. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _kerberized_ HDFS sink so that I can leverage Kerberos (open source distributed authentication system) for secured data writes into Hadoop.
R1615. As a user, I'd like to have the ability to mass-ingest data from various database systems so that I'm not restricted with the current approach (_jdbchdfs_) that is dependent on JDBC drivers.     *Spike Scope:*  * Identify integration options  * Collaborate to determine the design  * Document outcome (design specs)  
R1616. As a user, I would like to have an option to write data into HBase sink so that I can perform random, realtime read/write access on Big Data.
R1617. As a user, I'd like to have the option to write into _File Roll_ sink so that I can store events on the local file system.
R1618. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _JMX_ source module so that I can publish/subscribe to JMX notifications.  *Reference:* [Sprint Integration JMX Support|http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/system-management-chapter.html#jmx]
R1619. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _WebSocket_ source module so that I can create a interactive communication channel between user's browser session and the runtime to ingest browser based events and activities.  *Reference:* [Spring Integration WebSocket Support|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/tree/master/spring-integration-websocket/src]
R1620. As a user, I'd like to have an option of _AWS_ source module so that I can ingest data from Amazon S3 or use the Simple Email Service (SES).  *Reference:* [Spring Integration AWS Extension|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-extensions/tree/master/spring-integration-aws]
R1621. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _Cassandra_ sink, so I can leverage the NoSQL database to write high volumes of variable data segments in high velocity.
R1622. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _AWS_ sink so that I can write data into S3 directly.   *Reference:* [Spring Integration AWS Extension|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-extensions/tree/master/spring-integration-aws]
R1623. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _HAWQ_ sink so that I can write data directly into HAWQ via PXF extensions through Avro/Parquet format.
R1624. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _SOLR_ sink so that I can perform full-text indexing and search through SOLR backend server. 
R1625. As a user, I'd like to have the option to explicitly define/configure "error channel" so that I can stage and route the errors/exceptions through the dedicated channel and continue ingestion.  *Scenario:* * 'http' source ingest  * failure at either source, processor, or sink module * regardless of whether it is a custom module or not, traverse through the exception to propagate the actual _Caused by:..._, stage the error as payload, and route it to the error channel  *Example Configuration:* * error channel definition similar to "topic.errors.stream.module" * configure custom exception similar to "catch=**Exception" * exception hierarchy ** GlobalException ** DefaultException ** ModuleSpecificException 
R1626. As a user, I should not be allowed to create a custom module with a _reserved_ keywords so that I it will avoid confusions from seeing duplicate strings in deployment manifest.  *Example:* We would like to avoid a _custom_ module name of *producer* to eliminate the confusion below: {code}  xd:>stream deploy --name test1 --properties "module.producer.producer.deliveryMode= PERSISTENT,module.log.criteria=groups.contains('group1')"  {code}  [List of available reserved keywords|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Deployment#deployment-properties]
R1627. As a user, I'd like to retain the data partitioning state so that when I restart the containers, I continue to write based on the original partitioning strategy.   Currently, the state is not preserved; hence, on restarts the definition of partitioning strategy is lost due to different _hashCode()_.  *Design consideration:* Mine through the container info to derive the "partition index" instead of relying on _hashCode()_.
R1628. As a user, I'd like to have the data partition strategy state preserved so that when I add/delete modules, they are able to dynamically adapt to the strategy.  This is already included as part of the GA release. This story is to account for the testing effort.
R1629. It would be nice to have a simple ftp sink. I had to do it for one of my projects. Therefore, the sink already exists. I would like to contribute but I don't know how you do the 'testing' part for that kind of module.
R1630. stream create foo --definition "label: bar | xxxx"  stream deploy foo --properties "module.label.yyy=zzz" seems to work but it does not. The pre-validation is correct, but downstream, deployment logic still looks for module.bar (instead of module.label)

R1632. Please see the discussion here:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1183#issuecomment-55917701 
R1633. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _Basic Auth_ so that I'm challenged to provide _user name_ and _password_ when making a request.    Technical Implementation:    This functionality is provided in Spring Boot 1.1.x, it should be a matter of adding the spring boot security starter dependency to the spring-xd-dirt project.      It will be controlled using the spring boot property server.basic.enabled = true/false.  Our default in application.yml for this property should be false.    
R1634. As a user, I'd like to have the option to provide single-user security configurations so that I can override them as needed.    *Reference:*  [Spring Boot - Security|http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/boot-features-security.html]    *Scope:*  Configurations can be provided through _servers.yml_ file.
R1635. As a user, I want to be able to provide security credentials to the XD Shell so that I can interact with an xd admin server that is secured via basic auth    Technical implementation:    Add ---password and --username to the admin config command.      
R1636. As a user, I'd like to have latest Spring Boot snapshot pulled as a dependency so that I can inherit and implement the OOTB security features.
R1637. As a user, I'd like to have latest Spring Boot RELEASE pulled as a dependency so that I can inherit and implement the OOTB security features.
R1638. Create zip distribution for shell
R1639. Shell currently adds all jars from xd/lib to its classpath.  Remove jars that are not needed to run shell.
R1640. From time to time FilePollHdfsTest fails in the CI Acceptance Tests. The exception that is fired is as follows:  java.lang.AssertionError: java.lang.AssertionError: The data returned from hadoop was different than was sent.   expected:<942b9f47-8169-4dc3-a2ba-3d8fab04a4dc > but was:<null>  Need to investigate if this is a timing issue with the test (more than likely) or with the actual module.
R1641. Looks like the --fileExtension isn't used when compressing files with bzip2, some use cases requirer bz2 instead of bzip2 as the extension. Also, '.bz2' should be the default extension. At the same time we should change the default gzip extension to '.gz'.
R1642. Update the wiki to reflect the change from: runtime containers to cluster containers and runtime modules to cluster modules.  
R1643. As a user, I'd like to have a REST API to point and push an archive that includes custom module definitions and configurations so that I don't have to manually move and set it up.    *Scope of this spike:*  * Assess customer requirement, brainstorm, and document options  * Socialize with the team to collect feedback  * Identify phases  * Create new stories
R1644. Small follow up story to XD-2094 to improve tooltip handling.
R1645. As a user, I need a 'sandbox' Docker Image so that I can get started to experiment XD deployment with the following setup:    * Ubuntu OS  * Full XD Jar  * Java 7.x  * Redis  * RabbitMQ
R1646. As a user, I need a "production-ready' Docker Image so that I can use that as a baseline to deploy XD with the following setup.  * Ubuntu OS * Full XD Jar * Java 7.x
R1647. As a user, I need the ability to configure Docker XD Containers so that I can link to external services such as _Rabbit, Redis, Zookeeper, Hadoop, Mongo, etc_.  Includes pointers to: * Linking/binding attributes * Environment variables 
R1648. As a user, I want to configure Docker XD Containers using Service Discovery so that I can have tools to manage how processes and services in a cluster can find and talk to one another.
R1649. As a user, I need to have the ability to create docker images via CI build so that I can build all the components/configurations I need into a Docker image, test it, and deploy the image to various environments. 
R1650. As a user, I need a document covering our recommendations for deploying a XD cluster using Mesos with the Marathon Framework. 
R1651. As a user, I'd like to evaluate Spring Boot dependency upgrades so that I can make sure there aren't any side effects or impacts to existing functionalities.

R1653. The Gemfire XD database cannot be used to store the Spring XD metadata because the former doesn't support the default Spring Batch transaction isolation level ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE.  There looks to be no way to configure the Spring XD's internal Spring Batch JobRepository with another isolation level.  The JobRepository instance is getting created with default settings by the Spring Batch'es {{SimpleBatchConfiguration}} and there are no custom {{BatchConfigurer}}s available to change the default settings of the JobRepository.

R1655. In cases where the zookeeper ensemble is down or does not have quorum, the xd cluster effectively stops all work.  However the health status of the containers is "Up".  The container health status should be "Awaiting Zookeeper Session"  until it can get a successful zookeeper session.
R1656. One of the goal for a micro benchmark is to compare throughput difference  between two types of streams: 1. source | sink 2. source | processor | sink  For this test I used reactor-tcp source, throughput-sampler as sink and created a NoOp processor. Tests were performed on a single node container with direct binding turned on for all streams.  1. Throughput for "source|sink"  {noformat} stream create reactortcp --definition "reactor-ip --transport=tcp --port=4000 | throughput-sampler" stream deploy reactortcp --properties module.*.count=0 {noformat}  On my system I get following numbers: Throughput sampled for 5000000 items: 345423/s in 14475ms elapsed time  2. Throughput for "source|processor|sink"  Code for NoOpProcessor is available here: https://github.com/parikhkc/xd-noop-processor  {noformat} stream create reactornoop --definition "reactor-ip --transport=tcp --port=5000 | noopprocessor | throughput-sampler" stream deploy reactornoop --properties module.*.count=0 {noformat}  On the same system the throughput reduces to less then 70K/sec.

R1657. When simulating a slow network by deploying a Zookeeper with 3 nodes. * Zookeeper 1 (follower)was located at US-East-1 * Zookeeper 2 (follower) was in Sydney  * Zookeeper 3 (Leader) was in Sydney XD Admin and containers were running in US-East-1 Zone  In this case we simulated a loss of quorum by killing the zookeeper 2 (follower in Sydney).  All modules were undeployed.  When I restarted the zookeeper 2 all containers and admin recognized the ensemble was up and tried to redeploy the modules, but the stream was left in a "Failed" state.  Steps to reproduce:  * Deploy Stream "http|file" * Start Data Flow to stream from JMeter * Terminate ZK Follower in AU * Restart ZK Follower in AU  The workaround is to undeploy and deploy the stream.

R1659. As a user, I'd like to have the option to supply data partitioning strategy so that I can parallelize ingest of data from RDBMS to HDFS.
R1660. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _HDFS_ source module so that I can ingest data directly from HDFS file system.
R1661. As a user, I'd like to override the default "commit-interval" so that I can configure commit interval depending on data volume.    *Note:*  This would apply for all OOTB jobs that has partition support. The property could be part of _servers.yml_ file.
R1662. As a user, I want to know my configuration options are for enabling SSL/HTTPS and Basic authentication for administration endpoints, so that I can secure my application.
R1663. As a user, I want to know how to enable and configure LDAP as an authentication provider for the administration server, so that I can set up my security configuration accordingly.
R1664. Once the container's management server is secured, the admin server needs to know which REST template to use to get the message rates from the deployed modules inside the containers.
R1665. Once the container's management server is secured, the admin server needs to know which REST template to use to get the message rates from the deployed modules inside the containers.
R1666. Once the container's management server is secured, the admin server needs to know which REST template to use to get the message rates from the deployed modules inside the containers.
R1667. Once the container's management server is secured, the admin server needs to know which REST template to use to get the message rates from the deployed modules inside the containers.
R1668. The hdfs sink needs to have a unique stream name.  Because the twitterSearch test uses the "defaultName" and it may broadcast more than one message to the sink for the search.  So when the stream is destroyed the message is abandoned until hdfsTest starts up using the same  "defaultName" and the message is delivered to hdfs sink and thus the twitter data is written to the file.  
R1669. Need to add a retry to the mkdir command, in the case that it fails.
R1670. If the security is enabled for the container, then admin server won't be able to fetch the message rates for the deployed modules in that container.  The REST endpoint 'cluster/containers' needs to be fixed.

R1676. Decouple from DeploymentListener. Make DL a public class to handle deployment related events.  Remove createSimpleModule() and createComposedModule() from DL.  This will be delegated to ModuleDeployer which will eventually be further refactored to use the proposed ModuleFactory.
R1677. ModuleFactory is responsible for determining how the Module application context is created from available sources at the resource location exposed via the ModuleDefinition. The factory creates the application context and creates a SimpleModule or CompositeModule as appropropriate. For example, if an XML file is present, it is assumed to be the bean definition file used to create a CXMLAC. If no XML file is present, inspect the properties file for the existence of well-known properties such as base-package-name for component scanning for an @Configuration, or a module-class-name for an Annotated POJO based module (see XD-2100).  The MF is also responsible for creating composite modules.   Also includes Module refactoring, add getApplicationContext() and probably setApplicationContext().  Also refactor CompositeModule code to use boot SpringApplicationBuilder    
R1678. Currently there is no ModuleRegistry contract for composite modules. The composed module definition is maintained in ZooKeeperModuleDefinitionRepository which delegates to the ModuleRegistry to define and validate component modules. The repository should be converted to a ModuleRegistry.
R1679. MR is responsible for looking up existing module definitions by name and type.  ModuleDefinition should contain name, type, and resource; where resource is a springframework.core.io.Resource containing the root path of the module definition. This could be file, classpath, http, hdfs or something else but the contents under this path will not be inspected or processed by MR. The exception is for composite modules which should contain a list of corresponding Resources.    Simplify ModuleDefinition - remove classpath. Provide support for CompositeModuleDefinition - requires a list of resources (possibly a subclass)    Also retire RedisModuleRegistry

Code below {code} /**  * Custom processor to be wired into a tap to throw an exception.  */  throw new RuntimeException("Error from processor") {code} 2: Create a sample main stream {code} xd:>stream create --name ticktock --definition "time | log" --deploy {code} 3: Tail the log to confirm the data is going to the sink. We see  'sink.ticktock' appearing in the log as expected. 4: Add a tap to the stream that will throw an exception. {code} xd:>stream create --name exTap --definition "tap:stream:ticktock > script --location=exceptionthrower.groovy | log" --deploy {code} 5: Tail the log and we see that there are no more 'sink.ticktock' strings being logged. Looks like the main stream is no longer sending messages to the sink.

R1698. see ModuleDeployer.setApplicationContext(). It appears the shared server context (child of global) is incorrectly set as the module context's parent. However, the first attempt caused some test failures, so this needs further investigation. Things still function correctly, but is not according to design. 
R1699. With the implementation of XD-1864, we need to make sure that the (paginated) data returned from the REST endpoints has proper default ordering.    Up to now we have done client-side ordering in the Admin UI, but with server-side pagination, the server-side should support proper pagination as well.    Eventually, we may even decide to provide more flexible ordering options (ASC vs DESC, sort on different properties etc.), which may be a separate Jira.

R1708. Often it is useful to have access to the median value for fields of a data stream since they are more robust with respect to outliers.  The median is defined as the value of a dataset such that, when sorted, 50% of the data is smaller than the value and 50% of the data is larger then the value. Ordinarily this is difficult to calculate on a stream because it requires the collection and sorting of all data.  The median of a data stream can be approximated with a technique called stochastic averaging. To approximate the median value of a data stream one could use the following approach: Given the current estimate of the median {{M}}. If the next observed value in the stream is larger than {{M}}, increase the current estimate by {{r}} (= the learning rate). If it is smaller, decrease the estimate by {{r}}. When {{M}} is close to the median, it increases as often as it decreases, and therefore it stabilizes.   The following example shows a primitive implementation of the above mentioned algorithm in groovy (to be placed under ${XD_HOME}/modules/processor/scripts). {code:groovy} import org.springframework.xd.tuple.TupleBuilder; import org.springframework.xd.tuple.Tuple;  /**  * Stochastic averaging to compute the median of a data stream.  * To approximate this value using stochastic optimization, the value  * of interest is the current estimate of the median M. If the next observed   * value of the stream is larger than M, increase by r. If it is smaller decrease the  * estimate by r. When M is close to the median, it increases as often as it decreases,  * and therefore stablilizes.  * r denotes the learningRate.  */ enum MedianEstimator{      INSTANCE    //TODO Add support for estimating multiple medians   /*    * The current median value.    */   double current = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY      public double update(double value, double learningRate){          //Initialize current with given value     if(current == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY){        current = value     }          if(current == value){       return current     }      //Move current value towards the median     current = current + (current < value ? learningRate : -learningRate)      return current   } }  //TODO Make learning rate configurable def learningRate = 0.7 //TODO Add support for dynamic field selection. double median = MedianEstimator.INSTANCE.update(payload.getDouble('value'), learningRate)  def fieldNames = new ArrayList<String>(payload.getFieldNames()) def fieldValues = new ArrayList<Object>(payload.getValues())  //TODO Add make median output field configurable fieldNames.add("value_median") fieldValues.add(median)  //Return the original tuple values extended with the computed median. TupleBuilder.tuple().ofNamesAndValues(fieldNames, fieldValues) {code}  Stream definition: {code} xd:>stream create median --definition "http --outputType=application/x-xd-tuple | script --location=median-est.groovy | log" --deploy Created and deployed new stream 'median' {code}  Post some JSON data... {code} xd:>http post --contentType application/json --data '{"value":2}' > POST (application/json;charset=UTF-8) http://localhost:9000 {"value":2} > 200 OK {code}  Output: {code} 20:44:37,829  INFO pool-35-thread-4 sink.median - {"id":"cd9719b3-eeff-59c9-fdf1-fdb628c7fbb8","timestamp":1413139477829,"value":"2","value_median":2.0} {code}  ... After ~15 the median value should stabilize.  This approach was taken from the book "Real-time Analytics - Techniques to Analyze and Visualize Streaming Data" P. 296 / Byron Ellis / Wiley  Open points: - Support for resetting the median value - Better state management (Redis?) - Support median estimation for multiple fields - Make learning rate configurable from outside - Maybe add this as aggregate-counter aggregation strategy?
R1709. The current representation of REST resources of time-series data (e.g. aggregate counter) can lead to problems in consuming applications.  Despite the time series data provided by the "counts" data structure is logically ordered by key (timestamps) it doesn't guarantee an ordering, since many consuming applications interpret JSON data as an unordered map like data structure.  Because of this consuming applications have to apply special ordering / transformation logic to get the data in an chronologically ordered fashion. It would be helpful if one could configure the rendering of the time series data, e.g. as a list of json object like: {code:json} {  "ts":"Sun Oct 12 23:10:23 CEST 2014"  ,"value": 42 }  {code} Where {{ts}} denotes the timestamp and {{value}} denotes the value. It would also be helpful if one could adjust the date format either with a pattern or a well known date format like, c.f.  {{ISO 8601}}.  I attached a python example for this that demonstrates the problem.  Steps to reproduce: Create stream {code} xd:>stream create test --definition "http | filter --expression=payload.contains('pivotal') | log" {code}  Create tap on stream with aggregate-counter {code} xd:>stream create test_tap --definition "tap:stream:test.filter > aggregate-counter" {code}  Post some http data {code} xd:>http post --data "Hello pivotal data labs" #...some more data... {code}  Display aggregate counter {code} xd:>aggregate-counter display test_tap --resolution minute   AggregateCounter=test_tap   -----------------------------  -  -----   TIME                           -  COUNT   Sun Oct 12 23:10:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Sun Oct 12 23:11:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Sun Oct 12 23:12:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Sun Oct 12 23:13:23 CEST 2014  |  0   ...   Mon Oct 13 00:02:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Mon Oct 13 00:03:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Mon Oct 13 00:04:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Mon Oct 13 00:05:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Mon Oct 13 00:06:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Mon Oct 13 00:07:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Mon Oct 13 00:08:23 CEST 2014  |  3   Mon Oct 13 00:09:23 CEST 2014  |  1 {code}  Install python Requests library (REST support) {code} pip install Requests {code}  Start a python console (or IPythonNotebook) and run the following program: {code:python} import requests import json  res = requests.get("http://localhost:9393/metrics/aggregate-counters/test_tap?resolution=minute") status_object = json.loads(res.content) print(json.dumps(status_object, indent=4)) {code}  The above program should result in a similar output, but as one can see, due to pythons interpretation of the JSON object as a dict, the order of the keys in the output got mixed up.   Instead of showing the counts ....3 and then 1 ... as in the example above. This is just one example of how the current representation of the rest resource could lead to problems in consuming applications.   {code:json} {     "counts": {         "2014-10-12T21:26:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:15:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:22:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:49:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:35:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:47:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:18:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:12:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:16:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:57:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:28:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:08:28.553Z": 3,         "2014-10-12T21:40:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:06:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:27:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:52:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:11:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:05:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:29:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:24:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:56:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:43:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:00:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:10:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:58:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:21:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:32:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:46:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:04:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:02:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:51:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:38:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:31:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:20:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:54:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:07:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:03:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:34:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:09:28.553Z": 1,         "2014-10-12T21:44:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:17:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:53:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:19:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:30:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:23:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:36:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:41:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:13:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:59:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:01:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:33:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:45:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:39:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:50:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:37:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T22:14:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:25:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:55:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:42:28.553Z": 0,         "2014-10-12T21:48:28.553Z": 0     },     "name": "test_tap",     "links": [         {             "href": "http://localhost:9393/metrics/aggregate-counters/test_tap",             "rel": "self"         }     ] } {code}

R1712. When a container joins the XD cluster (via ZooKeeper) it triggers stream/job module deployments for modules that need to be deployed. If multiple containers are being started at around the same time, this can result in the first few containers taking all of the deployments while leaving the rest without any deployments.    To solve this, we will introduce a "quiet period" where no deployments will be triggered within _n_ seconds of a container joining, where _n_ will have a default value (perhaps 5 to 10 seconds). This value will be configurable.

Once this happens, both streams and jobs cannot be deployed. For whatever reason the "status" znode goes missing.    The only way for us to get the cluster back to working state, is to clear the zk znode /xd tree and restart spring-xd. At which point, we have to recreate all our streams and jobs back again..   /xd/deployments/streams/testCreateStream_SrcHttp_SinkFile1413234903170/status  NoNode Exception:  13 Oct 2014 14:16:16,044   INFO DeploymentSupervisorCacheListener-0 server.InitialDeploymentListener -

R1717. We are using the SpringXD REST endpoints for creating and managing streams. With Version 1.0.0 and 1.0.1, the Stream Definition API Call Times-out at times.

R1718. Look at the below Stream definition. This gets to "deployed" state even without the corresponding job. And then from there the same Job or any other Job can't be deployed and it goes to a hung state.     Here is an example of the Stream definition:    stream create --name jobName --definition "file --ref=true --dir=/tmp/springxdsource/dropbox --pattern=*.csv > queue:job:filetsjob-sample002" --deploy  
R1719. * Steps to reproduce.  ** Start admin & container.  ** Follow the instructions from https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Sources#gemfire-source  *** When you post the message is when the stacktrace shows up in the container.    Copying the gemfire-7.0.2.jar to the lib directory will resolve the error.    The stacktrace is attached.  
R1720. As a user, I'd like to have the flexibility to specify config options for IP and Hostname so that I can list the correct configuration for XD Admin and XD Container servers in the Admin-UI and Shell. 
R1721. When answering support questions, the first step is to determine what version of the software the customer is using. This question can be easily answered if we log the version as one of the fields in the log file. For example:    {noformat}  10:44:21,212 1.0.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT  INFO DeploymentSupervisorCacheListener-0 server.ContainerListener - Container arrived: Container{name='431baa56-b23b-48fc-b37d-18b52231e799', attributes={ip=192.168.25.177, host=Patrick-Peralta-MacBook-Pro.local, groups=, pid=38004, id=431baa56-b23b-48fc-b37d-18b52231e799}}  {noformat}    This way when we receive log snippets (initial support inquires rarely include the entire log file) we can immediately determine if the issue has already been fixed in a later release.  
R1722. If you create more than 4 gemfire modules, the container will throw a OOME Permgen on Java 7.    The solution is to put a technote into the wiki for the gemfire modules stating that for Java 7 they will need to add the following to environment.   export JAVA_OPTS="-XX:PermSize=256m"
R1723. Provide a BPP to do this in the StreamPlugin.  (Possibly JobPlugin as well). Remove auto-startup="false" in existing module configs.
R1724. The jdbc sink is currently limited to handling the entire payload as a string and converting a single json object to row data. We should improve that and support the following input types:   - LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap (single row)  - List<LinkedCaseInsensitiveMap> (multiple rows as a batch insert)  - JSON string {"ID":74488,"NAME":"Foo","YEAR":"2014"} (single row)  - JSON array [{"ID":74488,"NAME":"Foo","YEAR":"2014"},{"ID":74489,"NAME":"Bar","YEAR":"2014"}] (multiple rows as a batch insert)  - none of the above use payload.toString()  The above matches what the new jdbc source puts out (depending on outputType used)
R1725. The ChannelPipelineFactory used by the HTTP source should cache expensive objects used by the ChannelPipeline between requests, because creating them every time is inefficient (and in the case of HTTPS it can become even more expensive).

R1753. Rerun test XD-2278 on a EC2 32 core machine and see when we max out.
R1754. CMD should contain not only name and type of the child module, but also capture the options that were used in the composition. An intermediate between ModuleDefinition and ModuleDescriptor should be created for that purpose (and maybe be part of ModuleDescriptor then)
R1755. Composed Module currently behave as "white boxes". As soon as a module is composed (say "http | filter") then all options of the children modules are available (as e.g. http.port and filter.expression in the example above).  Change this so that a composed module is a black box: user has to explicitly expose an option for it to be available (most certainly using a short name). Hardcoding of values would be retained (and possibly overridable).  Possible syntaxes : 1) {code} module compose foo --definition "http --port=${myport:1234} | filter" {code}  2) {code} module compose foo --definition "http | filter" --expose port {code}  2.1) in case of ambiguity (simulated in this particular example): {code} module compose foo --definition "http | filter" --expose http.port {code}  2.2) for specifying a default: {code} module compose foo --definition "http | filter" --expose port=1234 {code}  3) allow both 1) and 2), using 1) mainly for cases where we don't map 1 to 1 with the underlying option, e.g.: {code} filter --expression=${expr}+'foo' {code}  
R1756. Similar to {{time | log}}, we should ship a simple batch job that appends a timestamp to a file. This will make it much easier to validate job functionality, especially in automated tests.
R1757. ArchiveModuleRegistry and the use of Boot Archives inherently relies on java.io.File  Have ResourceModuleRegistry extend/compose ArchiveMR to transparently download and cache (remote) jars that may be located in a (non-file:) location.    The staging area should be customizable, but some subdir of java.io.tmpdir sounds like a sensible default
R1758. As a user, I'd like to have the ability to access the random port (generated by tomcat) of the admin server (via _xd-shell_) so that I can point to the server and continue my interactions.   *Spike Details:* * Research whether connecting _xd-shell_ directly to ZK is a good approach or have a LB in-charge for the interaction. * How about something other than a pointer to a ZK directory in the shell for folks to experiment a bit before getting a LB involved?  *Note:* On some hadoop/hdfs setups access to zk is mandatory from hdfs client libs. There are some HA and federation setups which would anyway require xd shell to get access to zk if fs shell commands are used. 
R1759. An aggregate counter query should return results inclusive of start and end time, [start,end] for time resolutions, minute, hour, day, month.  
R1760. Query parameters for resolution, from, and to should be documented along with how to specify the time string (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss).
R1761. This may be broken down into 2 issues. First of all we need to define the proper UI interaction for the CLI to deal with pagination and then of course the actual implementation.  
R1762.

R1763. As a user, I'd like to stream ingest audio and video data so that I can apply predictive analytics algorithms for facial detection.  *Spike scope:* * Research the feasibility of implementing [Motion-JPEG|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG] * Design specs on Motion-JPEG format  *Note:* [opencv|http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/doc/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html], although having OOTB support, it is not platform compatible. 
R1764. As a user, I'd like to have a config parameter preferably in _servers.yml_ file so that I can enable/disable message rates in the cluster view. 
R1765. As a user, I'd like to mass ingest data from databases (and others) into HDFS/HAWQ/GPDB so that I don't have to write custom code and as well as be able to ingest in an efficient way.

R1768. Need to update the Modules page and any other that describes top level xml files. Also describe alternate module implementations: XD-713, XD-1805, XD-2100
R1769. As a user, I'd like to use Kafka source through simple consumer API (as opposed to high-level) so that I can gain full control to offsets and partition assignment deterministically.    *Spike scope*:  - Study simple consumer API functionality  - Document findings, approach and next steps
R1770. *Spike Scope:*    * Experiment with identified options  * POC with the logical integration choice
R1771. As a user, I'd like to push the custom module (built as uber-jar) via a REST API so that I can install the custom module in cluster. 
R1772. *XD 1.1 M1 Release + PHD 2.1 Upgrade - Action Items:*    * Update to SHDP 2.1.M2,   * Add Hadoop 2.5 (hadoop25)  * Remove hadoop22  * Remove PHD 1.0 (phd1)   * Change PHD 2.x from phd20 to phd21  * Test PHD 2.0 with phd21
R1773. As a user, I'd like to have a sample app (GitHub project) so that I can use it as a reference while provisioning Spring XD cluster with Kafka.    Consider:  * Kafka as message bus  * Kafka as source    
R1774. Enhance the current jdbchdfs job in spring-xd to have an incremental load / delta load feature similar to sqoop. See sqoop documentation [here|http://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.4.5/SqoopUserGuide.html#_incremental_imports]. The job will need to maintain some state between executions in order to decide the start point for the next data load.     The jdbchdfs job definition could take the following 2 new options.     h5. checkColumn   optional  Specifies the column to be examined when determining which rows to import. (the column should not be of type CHAR/NCHAR/VARCHAR/VARNCHAR/ LONGVARCHAR/LONGNVARCHAR). Column should be numeric or timestamp.  h5. lastValue   optional  If specified this will override any data saved from previous job runs. If not specified will take the saved max-value from the last job run. If no last job run data is available then it will not be an incremental load and all the data which satisfies the query will be used.    Sqoop provides 2 modes of operation for incremental load, 'append' and 'lastModified'. For jdbchdfs the job will always append as it is writing to a hdfs file.    Example: To import data from the database table some_table which has a last update column called lastUpdated, you could use.  {code}  xd:> job create myjob --definition "jdbchdfs --sql='select col1,col2,col3 from some_table' --checkColumn=lastUpdated" --deploy  {code}    The batch job should also be capable of being partitioned to run in parallel across multiple containers

R1776. As a user, I'd like to have a _generator_ source module so that I can create a number of messages of a specified size (similar to Rabbit's PerfTest utility).  Example: generator --numMsgs 10000 --msgSize 1024 --numThreads 1 
R1777. As a user, I'd like to have a _perf-meter_ sink that will collect and push metrics to the standard container log file.    Example: perf-meter --numMsgs 1000  Will write to the container log a timestamp, message count, and message rate every 1000 messages.  The message rate is the value since the last log event.  Default values are those specified above. 
R1778. As a user, I'd like to create a stream such as _generator | perf-meter_ so that I can ingest 1M messages of 1000 bytes and one thread using XD's 'singlenode' container and measure performance characteristics.
R1779. Send 1M messages of 1000 bytes via the generator, vary the number of producer threads.  Measure the msg/sec rate and calculate the data transfer rate in MB/sec.  *Number of threads* * 2 * 4 * 8
R1780. * Update Angular Growl to v2  * Allowing for stoppable notifications (in case you want to see it for longer than 5 secs)  
R1781. There is a bug in the deployments rest end-point.     *How to reproduce:*     * Deploy a Batch job (success) that for example does not all necessary libraries in the class-patch and thus causes a “java.lang.ClassNotFoundException�?    *Result:*    You cannot retrieve the list of deployments list anymore using:    * http://localhost:9393/jobs/configurations    The rest endpoint will now report:    [{"links":[],"logref":"NoSuchBatchJobException","message":"Batch Job with the name myJob doesn't exist"}]    This message is not entirely wrong…but extremely misleading. I think we should still return the entire list and rather mark the job as having an error.    Also returning an “404 Not Found�? is misleading as well.  
R1782. User should have the option of Greenplum DB sink so they can write data directly to Greenplum DB via the pgfdist/gploader (Greenplum bulk loader).  The existing JDBC sinks are not suitable for high volume loads. The JDBC approach utilizes the master segment of Greenplum for loading datasets instead of the bulk loader utility.
R1783. Create various boot starter projects for module developers. This should include templates for source, processor, sink, and job and ideally different options for each. For example, a processor configured with XML, SI Java DSL, or SI Java DSL with lambdas.  
R1784. Create a dedicated Launch Page for Jobs. Currently we create a launch form underneath the deployments table. That is a bit unwieldy when many deployed jobs are shown in the table.
R1785. Create a dedicated Scheduling Page for Jobs. Currently we create a form underneath the deployments table. That is a bit unwieldy when many deployed jobs are shown in the table.    Similar to XD-2320
R1786. The field exists and it is referred to in application.yml, but it does not have a setter and the bus will always use the configured default, which is 1.

R1788. {{JobCommandTests}} in xd-shell only uses a {{LocalMessageBus}} so the problem in XD-2323 was not discovered until a manual integration test was executed.  At a minimum, {{JobCommandTests.testLaunchPartitionedJob()}} should be run with all bus implementations.
R1789. We have to explicitly set it to false, in order to avoid an early start of the poller and the associated DistpatcherHasNoSubscribersException.

R1791. XD, gemfire, directories in the zip file are missing.
R1792. *Version:*  XD 1.0.1  Mac OSX 10.9.5    *Problem:*  - Deployed a simple batch job in 'singlenode'  - Laptop put to sleep mode  - After login: notice that ZK is establishing connection   - Continues to clean-up prior to redeployment, but never goes through successfully  - Listing job both in UI and Shell states it is "undeployed"    *Gunnar's experiment:*  - System is running in Single Node  - Laptop goes to sleep  - After waking up your laptop from sleep, you cannot retrieve the list of deployed jobs anymore (in AdminUI)    *Error:*  Only getting back a *404* - "NoSuchBatchJobException", "Batch Job with the name abcd doesn't exist"
R1793. It is easy to get a cron expression wrong.     Provide validation of the cron expression on the Schedule Job page using async validation.     * Submit the cron expression to the server-side - and validate that the expression is valid.  * Send a success message back (we may even send back some meta data … e.g. when is the next execution going to take place)  
R1794. As a PM, I'd like to have test coverage for both Kafka source and sink modules so that we can assert its functionality as part of the CI builds. 
R1795. Since Kafka and Rabbit have different strategies on how a message system is implemented, we will need to update the tests used on rabbit to work with Kafka.  While they will not be exactly the same as before, they should exercise the same principles.  This story covers:   * Create the consumer and producer execution configurations for  kafka-producer-perf-test.sh and kafka-consumer-perf-test.sh.   * Record the tests a spreadsheet much like the Rabbit Base test spreadsheet    
R1796. Create an AMI that will contain the Kafka Executable as well as the Kafka performance test tools.
R1797. Requesting a ZeroMQ based source.  
R1798. Looks like upgrade to Gradle 2.2 is not a simple version change, e.g. I see:   {code} FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.  * Where: Build file '/Users/hillert/dev/git/spring-xd/build.gradle' line: 219  * What went wrong: A problem occurred evaluating root project 'spring-xd'. > Could not find method forceDependencyVersions() for arguments [project ':documentation-toolchain'] on root project 'spring-xd'. {code}
R1799. There are some modules that use external config properties (kafka producer/consumer, hadoop properties etc.,). We need to avoid using such properties and have them configured inside module so that module and its properties are self contained.    
R1800. Using single-node deployment of Spring XD 1.0 GA, we needed to redefine several batch jobs. We deleted the jobs ("job destroy all"). When attempting to re-add, we received an error that a job with the name already exists. Performing "job list" confirms the jobs were gone.  To workaround, I needed to terminate the instance (server) of Spring XD and restart it. Since this was the single-node deployment without a live stream of data coming in this was okay, but would have been a major problem if bouncing the Spring XD server was not acceptable (i.e., live data being actively received).
R1801. Password for 'jdbchdfs' job definition is only hashing the initial portion of the password not the entire password (See attached image).    The password has an '_' char but it shouldn't matter. The entire password should be masked with '*' instead.
R1802. Currently, module composition always guesses the correct type because we don't have a module with a given name N that is both a source and a processor, or a processor and a sink (we only have the case source and sink, as in jdbc/jdbc or file/file).  If it were the case, then the heuristics for guessing the resulting type of a composition would break.  This issue is about adding the option for the user to explicitly specify the expected type of the composition, /if needed/.
R1803. Trying to deploy the `timestampfile` job using the UI.    Seems the UI doesn't quote string parameters that contains a space so the job creation fails.    Keeping all the defaults I get the following "Resulting Definition" in the UI:    timestampfile --restartable=false --directory=/tmp/xd/output/ --fileExtension=txt --fileName=${xd.job.name} --format=yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss --dateFormat=yyyy-MM-dd --makeUnique=true    (note: the --format parameter has a space)    which causes:    XD100E:(pos 128): Found unexpected data after stream definition: 'HH' timestampfile --restartable=false --directory=/tmp/xd/output/ --fileExtension=txt --fileName=${xd.job.name} --format=yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss --dateFormat=yyyy-MM-dd --makeUnique=true *^  
R1804. Trying to use the XD UI with Internet Explorer (version 11.0.9600.17031) is difficult. The screen doesn't refresh when streams/jobs are created or deployed. Had to erase the browsing history continuously to get state updates to show in the UI.
R1805. As a user, I'd like to refer to documentation in wiki so that I can setup and configure Kafka as a message bus as recommended. 
R1806. As a user, I'd like to refer to documentation in wiki so that I can setup and configure Spark as a Batch job as recommended.

R1808. Install a boot uberjar containing custom modules plus stream and job definitions, and possibly specific configuration. This potentially includes the ability to export and import all deployable resources defined in an XD environment.  
R1809. We are referencing Spring.IO deps when we shouldn't (since we moved to a different version of boot than in in the platform).
R1810. spring.groovy.template.check-template-location=false must now be set in the properties file.  
R1811. Many of the tests fail with:    {code}  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot find template location: class path resource [templates/] (please add some templates, check your Groovy configuration, or set spring.groovy.template.check-template-location=false)  {code}    Somehow we need to disable this check, using the property suggested.
R1812. If you start xd-singlenode with the --verbose flag the configuration information is printed twice.    Steps to reproduce   1) run {{xd-singlenode --verbose}}    Example output:  {code}     _____                           __   _______  /  ___|          (-)             \ \ / /  _  \  \ `--. _ __  _ __ _

R1813. As a user, I want to be able to control the starting offset of the Kafka source when a stream is deployed, so that I can replay a topic if necessary.    Note:  - starting offset is only considered when the stream is deployed  - progress made by modules must survive their crash for a running stream  - undeploying and redeploying a stream with a specific start offset will cause the stream to read again from the start     TBD: what happens when streams are undeployed/redeployed - where do they resume from?
R1814. As a user, I want to be able to control the partition allocation for the Kafka source modules when a stream is deployed, so that I can colocate with other data sources.
R1815. As a user, I want Spring XD to pre-allocate a set of partitions between the Kafka source modules when a stream is deployed, so that deployment is simpler, and rebalancing doesn’t take place. 
R1816. As a user, I want Spring XD’s message bus to be able to pre-allocate partitions between nodes when a stream is deployed, so that rebalancing doesn’t happen when a container crashes and/or it’s redeployed.
R1817. * Create the infrastructure (Mongo, Hadoop, ActiveMQ, Gemfire, Mysql, etc) in EC2 for the 1.0.2 acceptance tests  * Retrofit the 1.0.2 to use the new infrastructure  * Create a 1.0.2 branch for XD-EC2
R1818. This doesn't follow the conventions we have with other modules and it also means it isn't easy to override via environment variables etc.  This is in HDFS and some others.

R1821. TypeConvertingStreamTests.testBasicTypeConversionWithTap() is failing intermittently. Why?
R1822. As a continuation, we would like to further investigate Spark, develop POC and identify the best appropriate design and implementation for XD.
R1823. "the meaning of the backtick has changed. The backtick now only does monospaced formatting, it does not escape the content. The migration guide walks you through the options:   http://asciidoctor.org/docs/migration/#migration-scenarios  "  For more details see: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/issues/134
R1824. The acceptance tests cover the entire suite of script tests.  Thus they are no longer needed.  The only test that was remaining was posting 10 messages to a http source and writing to a long and making sure we didn't get an error.  This test (httpbash) was never called from the scripts CI build.
R1825. Often one has to perform some basic conversion / parsings in Stream definitions. It would be helpful if one could provide some helper functions to simplify SpEL expressions.  E.g. instead of: {code} transform --expression=T(java.lang.Long).parseLong(payload.value.toString()) {code} it would be nice to be able to write: {code} transform --expression=parseLong(payload.value) {code}  I'm thinking of support for: * parseByte * parseInt * parseShort * parseLong * parseFloat * parseDouble * parseBoolean * parseTuple  (I don't think we'd need support for parseCharacter)  This issue is about: 1) providing the centralised infrastructure for defining the SpEL expressions 2) Add support for the above listed predefined SpEL expressions  Those functions should be able to work with String based as well as {{JsonToStringFriendlyNode}} as input.
R1826. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26880903/using-mappedrequestheaders-in-spring-xd  
R1827. After each test execution, the containers are shut down via:  {code} @After public void after() { 	distributedTestSupport.shutdownContainers(); 	distributedTestSupport.ensureTemplate().streamOperations().destroyAll(); } ... public void shutdownContainers() { 	for (Iterator<Map.Entry<Long, JavaApplication<SimpleJavaApplication>>> iterator = 				mapPidContainers.entrySet().iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) { 		iterator.next().getValue().close(); 		iterator.remove(); 	} } {code}  The problem is that {{close()}} guarantees that the process is shut down, but it does not guarantee that the container is no longer registered in ZooKeeper. The cleanup procedure should verify that no containers appear in the output of  the {{runtime containers}} shell command. This will prevent the next test from deploying to a non-existent container.
R1828. As a user, I'd like to have a _reactor-stream_ processor module so that I can ingest data using XD source modules and process them as time-window operations.     *Example 1:*  http | reactor-stream --timeWindow=10s --field=payload.sensorData --expressions=min,avg    This would give you 10 second time window of the min and avg values.    *Example 2:*  Reactor as a module    *Example 3:*  Integration with Spark streaming and reactor
R1829. As a user, I'd like to have _microbatching_ capability so that I can ingest based on batch intervals for enhanced performance throughput.     *Example:*  "http --batchInterval=10 | log"
R1830. As a user, I'd like to have API and Documentation links in the ["About"|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/spring-xd-ui/app/scripts/shared/views/about.html] section within _admin-ui_.     It would be ideal to have the version # dynamically replaced for every release.  
R1831. While there is a server endpoint to logout, we don't have that ability yet from the UI. As indicated by XD-2122 we will also need a meta-data REST endpoint  so we can interrogate whether security is enabled, whether the user is logged etc. So we can fulfill the requirements:     * Show a logout button only if a) security is enabled and b) user is logged in  * Show the username and/or full name of the user being logged in   
R1832. The {{syslog-tcp}} source uses the default tcp connection factory which has an unbounded thread pool; this can cause OOM if the bus blocks (e.g. rabbit is out of resources). 
R1833. A new sink that would POST the message payload to a REST service over http.

R1834. *Refactoring scope:* (_spring-xd-dirt_)  * Message bus dependencies      The goal is to decouple them from startup phase to further enhance initialization time. 
R1835. As a developer, I'd like to setup a performance testing infrastructure (rackspace), so I can start benching Kafka baselines and continue with XD use-cases.
R1836. As a user, I'd like to have a Shell command so that I can point to the custom-built _module_ archive and push it to the runtime for immediate usage. 
R1837. As a user, I'd like to refer to documentation so that I can build the custom module based on recommended standards and patterns.
R1838. The hdfs-dataset sink currently requires a POJO as input. We should also support JSON and a Map as input plus the ability to specify an Avro schema to be used.
R1839. As a user, I'd like to have the custom module (built as uber-jar) hosted in HDFS so that I can deploy the module to newly arriving containers. 
R1840. Currently I believe we only mention labels in this section of the doc:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/DSL-Reference#labels    And it is not even clear there that they are *required* when 2 or more module names would otherwise be ambiguous. It was probably written before we made that a mandatory part of the definition.    We should mention this somewhere in the 'streams' section of the manual. Even if none of the examples there currently have more than one occurrence of the same module, we should add one to illustrate this point.  
R1841. Verify that network interruptions will not negatively affect the XD cluster.    Verify that a container that looses connectivity will be able to rejoin the cluster cleanly.  Modules will redploy when the network is back up.  
R1842. Scope is to have integration test coverage for source and sink modules. 
R1843. Users should have the ability to load data from a jdbc source to a file sink pointing to a file location (NFS mount to an Isilon cluster) in a particular directory structure.  Isilon support multiple protocols, including NFS and HDFS. by storing data directly into an NFS mount we would eliminate the HDFS overhead.  This functionality should be similar to the jdbchdfs job that is currently available in SpringXD. See Jira issue 'XD-2309' for more details.
R1844. A scenario where I have multiple jobs deployed to one singlenode or distributed instance of SpringXD that need to use different namenodes can easily exist.   The ability to specify a namenode, much the same way I can specify a directory would solve this problem.  The desired behavior would be to specify a namenode that wasn't set using 'hadoop config fs <namenode>' in the job description and have that value used instead of the value set at the SpringXD global level.
R1845. In order to identify potential problems that may occur if XD is running for multiple hours we need to create a long duration test regime. Create an environment from which we can run both Singlenode and a simple cluster (1 Admin 2 container) for 24+ hours.  * Create 2 simple streams   * http|file  * file|log  * Send data to http source 2 times a second for 24 hours * This test should execute checkprocs every 5 minutes to capture and record the status of the XD> * Record memory usage and system load.
R1846. *Version:*  XD: 1.1 M1    *Problem:*  Trying to use tcp-client source module and observing an exception while deploying the stream.    *Stream Definition:*  {code:xml}   curl --data name=dummy-firehose --data definition='tcp-client --decoder=LF --port=8080 | log' --data deploy=true http://localhost:9393/streams/definitions  {"name":"dummy-firehose","status":null,"definition":"tcp-client --decoder=LF --port=8080 | log","_links":{"self":{"href":"http://localhost:9393/streams/dummy-firehose"}}}  {code}    The same curl command works fine against XD 1.0.1 release.  
R1847. As a user, I should be able to leverage native _WebSocket_ sink so that I can take the advantage of full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection.
R1848. As a developer, I'd like to include the following improvements as part of the EC2 CI infrastructure, so that we can reliably run the CI builds and also assert over feature functionalities.    *Scope:*  * Enable 'distributed jvm test'  * Change from using artifactory gradle task to a command task (that calls ./gradlew)  * Test w/ embedded hadoop off  * Turn on maxParallelForks  
R1849. As a developer, I'd like to investigate the increase in WARN logs so that I can troubleshoot and fix PMD/Sonar violations.  Consider notifying the violations through SONAR configurations. The committer should be notified.
R1850. As a build manager, I'd like to setup CI infrastructure so that I can run integration tests in Windows OS automatically as we commit-trigger new builds.     *Scope:*  * Use the environment where Bamboo is running  * Gain access to powershell   * Setup services (redis, rabbit, etc.)  * Kick-off CI task
R1851. Provide A maven pom to support module projects that will declare the Spring XD dependencies as provided, configure the boot plugin for 'MODULE' layout and other boilerplate build configuration. This should include a similar feature for gradle.
R1852. Provide maven and gradle plugins to execute module upload via REST to upload and install a module to Spring XD.  e.g. mvn xd:upload-module ...  
R1853. Create one or more Sample module projects in the Spring XD Examples repo to serve as templates for Spring XD module projects. Similar to https://github.com/dturanski/siDslModule, these should include unit and single node integration tests, and demonstrate the use of Spring XD build and packaging tools, and other module development support. This may be split out into separate tasks, but should include a sample for source, processor, sink, and job, using @Configuration or XML configuration (either as separate samples or using build profiles). 
R1854. Would be nice to have the shell zip the contents of a directory if not already in zipped form. This way, the development cycle (if one decided to use upload) is quicker and edits can be done in place.
R1855. When a tap on a stream is undeployed and re-deployed, it stops working.  To make it work, the main stream associated with the tap needs to be undeployed and re-deployed.  
R1856. Having a pojo:  {code}  public class User{  	private String name;  	public String getName() {  		return user;  	}  	public void setName(String name) {  		this.name = name;  	}  }  {code}    with:  {code}  hdfs-dataset --inputType='application/x-java-object;type=test.User'  {code}    throws exception:  {code}  12:43:27,698 1.1.0.SNAP ERROR task-scheduler-1 handler.LoggingHandler - org.springframework.messaging.MessageHandlingException: Expression evaluation failed: payload.getClass().getName(); nested exception is org.springframework.expression.AccessException: Problem invoking method: public java.lang.String test.User.getName()  {code}    Which I believe is caused by `correlation-strategy-expression` spel in aggregator:  {code}  	<int:aggregator  			input-channel="input"  			correlation-strategy-expression="payload.getClass().getName()"  			release-strategy-expression="size() == ${batchSize}"  			expire-groups-upon-completion="true"  			send-partial-result-on-expiry="true"  			message-store="messageStore"  			output-channel="objects"/>  {code}    Changing `getName()` method in pojo to something else works.
R1857. The current implementation makes individual reads from redis and then writes back the average, so in a cluster environment the reads and writes are not serialized, client reads and writes for specific keys can interfere with each other.  Investigate options, such as use of redis transactions or use of lua scripting to solve this problem.
R1858. That method is actually currently never called, but :  - The case where a mapping already exists is not covered (outstanding TODO comment)  - the semantics of the method should just be to "save and override"    
R1859. hdfs-datasink should support rollover option, just like hdfs sink.  This might be mutually exclusive with batchSize option which also performs rollover.
R1860. Please see [hdfs-dataset 1.0.2.RELEASE docs|http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-xd/1.0.2.RELEASE/reference/html/#hdfs-dataset-avroparquet].    According to docs there should be "directory" option in this sink but in code "basePath" is used.
R1861. Attached is module properties file. Both custom Java classes referenced in the properties are available in the JAR file under _SPRING_XD_HOME/xd/module/<the-module>/lib_ directory.

R1864. The kafka sink supports properties for an async producer (e.g. {{queue.buffering.max.ms}} ) but you cannot enable such a producer (only {{sync}} ). Async producers batch messages (at the risk of message loss).    Add a new property {{async}} default {{false}} and add the corresponding attribute to the {{<int-kafka:producer-configuration/>}} element    {{async="$\{async\}"}}
R1865. See my comment on https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1295 for details
R1866. As a user, I'd like to have a common shared location so that I can place the dependent jar's that are required by 2 or more custom modules.   *Current Recommendation:* * Place the dependent jar under xd/lib folder * if it necessary to support different versions of jar's then bundle it in custom module to get around the _classloader_ problem, if a older/newer version exist in xd/lib
R1867. See Screenshot.    The error is caused when loading all stream definitions in method *loadStreamDefinitions*.     Only 1 or two streams exist in the system.   
R1868. When establishing the tap, we create the tap channel and add the WireTap before the tap channel has been bound to the bus.    {quote}  17:00:23,918 ERROR task-scheduler-8 handler.LoggingHandler - org.springframework.messaging.MessageDeliveryException: Dispatcher has no subscribers for channel 'tap:stream:foo.time.0.tap.bridge'.; nested exception is org.springframework.integration.MessageDispatchingException: Dispatcher has no subscribers    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractSubscribableChannel.doSend(AbstractSubscribableChannel.java:81)    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractMessageChannel.send(AbstractMessageChannel.java:277)    org.springframework.integration.channel.interceptor.WireTap.preSend(WireTap.java:129)  {quote}

R1870. SpringXD's syslog source cannot parse rfc5424 messages into a Map.  For the messages we get in RFC 3164, springXD converts these to a Map.    Since the rfc5424 data cannot be interpreted then the map contains just one key called 'UNDECODED'.  The result of this is that we get a string that looks like this (when we convert the message to a String)  {code}   {UNDECODED=<182>Dec 02 2014 07:56:35: %ASA-6-113008: AAA transaction status ACCEPT : user = jbloggs}  {code}    Should be something like this (note the values below are for illustrative purposes only and should not be used as test data)    {code}   {FACILITY=22, SEVERITY=6, TIMESTAMP=Tue Dec 02 07:56:35, HOST=the-hostname-that-sent-the-data, TAG=%ASA-6-113008, MESSAGE=........}  {code}    h3. Root Cause  Spring integration does not parse these messages. There is a JIRA for SI here:  https://jira.spring.io/browse/INT-3450  
R1871. Travis CI recently introduced docker based builds.  This prevents root access (which we don't need), but allows caching (which we could not use before) and seems to come with beefier machine specs
R1872. In order to improve the build reliability, we should be using the NPM repo provided by *repo.spring.io*     See *spring-xd-ui/README.md* for further details.

R1874. Based on the POC from XD-2124 we should create the actual implementation.    Things to consider to store in step context:  - capture Log output/MapReduce job counters  - capture last-value from incremental imports

R1901. This should include lifecycle management, so that when the module's stream is undeployed, the Spark Streaming application should be stopped, etc.    Deploying a number of module instances should result in multiple receiver tasks, and those should bind to the bus using the consumer side partitioning metadata.  
R1902. Thinking about the UBS(?) scenario that MP described. They want all their Cassandra modules to share a connection, leading to the need for a parent context for those modules. We could introduce a parent module for this purpose. The module declares a parent in its properties which likely ends up as a parent module definition in the module definition. When the child module is deployed, its parent must be deployed first if it is not already (i.e., parent is a singleton per container). The module sets that as it's parent context.  We would have to make sure things happen in the correct order so the global context is the parent of the parent (ad infinitum). The alternative is to add a module parent context to the XD hierarchy which is extensible, but this is more elegant IMHO.  Also, in cases that don't require singleton bean definitions, the parent could package and provide common jars to children, e.g., we set the parent module's classloader as the parent classloader, eliminating the need to install common jars in an HDFS path (basically the approach I described https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-2420)   MP : >> Also, in cases that don't require singleton bean definitions, the parent could package and provide common jars to children, e.g., we set the parent module's classloader as the parent classloader This approach does not offer some of the advantages offered by a central yaml config noted in the JIRA . But it is simpler in many ways. The developer just installs a parent module containing dependent jars and sets that as a parent in the child modules. This requires no additional infrastructure. To address the hadoop scenario we discussed, we would need another level of indirection so the parent of the hdfs modules is bound to the configured hadoop distro.   e.g. something like  parent = ${xd.hadoop.distro} in module properties  MF: Possibly the parent modules could go in the "common" directory? They should be considered "abstract" also - in the same sense as abstract bean definitions in a Spring context (and they should only be started on demand when needed by at least one concrete child module - then destroyed when the last child module is destroyed).  Maybe this would also allow us to wrap up those xml files that currently live in "common" so that they are treated as parent modules?  MF: Yea, that sounds good wrt to common.  Also it might be a good idea to enable spring to throw an error if it finds more than one bean of the same name in the application context - i think that applies to searching in parent contexts as well.  this would avoid the 'last one wins' rule and give more deterministic behavior. 
R1903. During an integration test over the weekend the cluster based tests failed.  They showed that a job was left in an inconsistent state (incomplete)   and other jdbc job tests failed because they could not connect to the database.    
R1904. As a user, I'd like to have concurrency and compression support for Kafka so that I can increase performance throughput and/or increase responsiveness    *Things to consider:*  * make global configuration options be "defaults" and allow per-deployment overrides  * add options for   ** concurrency  ** compression support
R1905. As a user, I'd like to have the option to _ACK_ messages so that I can guarantee that the message/request sent is successful. 
R1906. As a user, I'd like to have the option to implement _bindRequestor_ and _bindReplier_ so that I can "bind a producer that expects async replies" and "bind a consumer that handles requests from a requestor and asynchronously sends replies" respectively.     
R1907. As a user, I'd like to have the option to setup _batching_ so that I can ingest data in batches as opposed to payload-at-a-time.
R1908. As a user, I'd like to have the option to _stop_ an existing Sqoop job so that I can clean-up resources at the time of completion.
R1909. As a user, I'd like to access Sqoop logs so that I can troubleshoot or evaluate the errors or current state respectively.   We will have to identify how to capture the Sqoop logs and stream them to our logging mechanism.
R1910. As a user, I'd like to incremental-data-load so that I can retrieve only rows newer than some previously-imported.
R1911. As a QA, I'd like to benchmark _Sqoop_ vs. _jdbchdfs_ batch job so that I can compare and contrast performance stats. 
R1912. What is the core interface contract users will be exposed to when creating a processor module that uses Reactor's Stream API.   Some consideration for error handling should be considered as it maybe outside normal exception throwing signatures.
R1913. Currently, the {{source:trigger}} module is based on 3 profiles: {{date}}, {{cron}} or {{fixedDelay}}, where the latter has precedence over the former in {{TriggerSourceOptionsMetadata}}:    {code:java}  @Override  public String[] profilesToActivate() {      if (cron != null) {          return new String[] { "use-cron" };      }      else if (fixedDelay != null) {          return new String[] { "use-delay" };      }      else {          return new String[] { "use-date" };      }  }  {code}    Therefore it is not possible to combine {{date}} and {{fixedDelay}} to start off at a specific point in time, and then repeat every X seconds.    This is a request to provide another parameter to {{source:trigger}} such as *{{initialDelay}}* to be able to achieve the desired behaviour.
R1914. As a user, I would like to be able disable snappy compression when using hdfs-dataset sink with Avro files. I'd also like to be able to provide a different codec.
R1915. If a class is added to a batch execution context that is located in an isolated context, an exception will be thrown when that object is deserialized.  It appears the serialize doesn't use the ParentFirstClassloader during deserialization.
R1916. The module should be flexible to act as a sink as well as a processor.  ErrorHandling will be considered as part of another JIRA
R1917. A sample, perhaps taken from Pivotal Labs use-case in Denver, that would calculate some time window averages for a many individual senor values .
R1918. The code base is changing a bit, so using 2.0 M1 for development is stable up until all major JIRA issues have bee completed.  Then we should track snapshots in preparation to move to 2.0. M2 when it gets released.

The EXAMPLE in the documentation (and the paragraph preceding the example) for the "script" processor uses both "location" and "properties-location" options, but these are in actuality "script" and "locationProperties" according to "module info processor:script" and the text of the documentation.  See: http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.0.2.RELEASE/reference/html/#script   {quote}To use the module, pass the location of a Groovy script using the location attribute. If you want to pass variable values to your script, you can optionally pass the path to a properties file using the properties-location attribute. All properties in the file will be made available to the script as variables.  {code}xd:> stream create --name groovyprocessortest --definition "http --port=9006 | script --location=custom-processor.groovy --properties-location=custom-processor.properties | log" --deploy{code} {quote}

R1938. As a user, I'd like to have a separate _YML_ file to list the deployment manifest properties so that I don't have to include as part of the stream definition. 
R1939. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27491237/spring-xd-tcp-source-outputs-byte-array-instead-of-string-how-to-output-regu.   Same behavior as --outputType text/plain but more intuitive to use application/json if the stream author expects the source to emit json. No content validation will be done.   
R1940. As a user, I'd like to have the option to _compress_ messages so that I can influence the performance throughput. It'd be beneficial to have support for gzip, zip compression, and decompression.
R1941. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _compression_ for both Rabbit _source_ and _sink_ modules so that can further enhance the performance characteristics.
R1942. As a user, I'd like to have the option of _batching_ for the Rabbit _sink_ so that I can write data in batches as opposed to one-at-a-time. 
R1943. When trying to configure XD to use a RabbitMQ instance other than the default localhost:5672, a user is supposedto updated the "spring_rabbitmq_addresses" environment variable or the spring.rabbitmq.addresses setting in the servers.yml file.  In this case XD is ignoring this environment variable.      h3. Steps to reproduce     # set the transport by using "export XD_TRANSPORT=rabbit"  # set the spring_rabbitmq_addresses by "export spring_rabbitmq_addresses=foo:5672"  # Startup a admin container on your local machine  # deploy ticktock  #* this should fail  #* start up a local rabbitmq  #* deploy a new ticktock and stream will deploy.    
R1944. We should move the org.springframework.xd.batch.jdbc.ColumnRangePartitioner and org.springframework.xd.batch.item.jdbc.FieldSetSqlParameterSourceProvider to the spring-xd-extension-batch project
R1945. The Sqoop tasklet introduced an AbstractProcessBuilderTasklet implementation in XD-2430. We are now adding similar support to Batch SystemCommandTasklet in BATCH-2329, BATCH-2330 and BATCH-2331. We should refactor Sqoop and Spark tasklets to use the SystemCommandTasklet as base.
R1946. We need to add some integration tests for the Sqoop job introduced in XD-2430
R1947. https://jira.spring.io/browse/AMQP-453 Added support for compression with RabbitMQ.  XD should expose configuration options to enable and configure compression on the message bus.  Note, some options may be specific for brokers or require additional functionality in XD.      This issue should not address adding additional functionality to make the feature set as common as possible across msg bus implementations, but expose what makes sense with the current code base for rabbitmq   As an example, Kafka supports compressed.topics which lets you pick a subset of topics to be compressed.  
R1948. Commit https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/commit/8d28b2786acbdea1617d7e903b805e5af5369b90 removed MessageBus implementations from the main dirt classpath, but used a trick to have tests working (basically, MB classes *are* on the CP when in test scope).  This story is about adding more gradle projects that support classpath isolation when running tests (and also when authoring a MB implementation).  This would avoid false positives such as https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1340 were lacking jars go unnoticed
R1949. As a user, I'd like to have a gradle build option so that I can support module projects that will declare the Spring XD dependencies as provided, configure the boot plugin for 'MODULE' layout and other boilerplate build configuration.    This is dependent on Boot's module layout scoping issue: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2187

R1954. As a user, I'd like to refer to the documentation so that I can connect to Sqoop as recommended and create job definition based on the exposed _metadata_ options. 
R1955. When executing a Spark Application Job on XD against a remote Spark Master we receive a CNF exception for FSDataInputStream.  Running against a local[1] Spark Master works normally.  
R1956. As a performance tester, I'd like to rerun baseline benchmarks with batching enabled on Rabbit so that I can compare the results with previous performance snapshots.   Note: - batchingEnabled = true - batchingSize = 100 (default)  We could also vary default size to compute and record at granular level. 
R1957. As a performance tester, I'd like to re-run baseline benchmarks with compression enabled on Rabbit so that I can compare the results with previous performance snapshots. 
R1958. We wanted to bind the spring-xd to the public IP but am not able to do so.

R1962. As a user, I'd like to implement the core interface contract so that I can create a processor module that uses RxJava API.
R1963. As a user, I'd like to have a flexible RxJava module so that it can as a processor.   
R1964. As a user, I'd like to have the option to define access control list (ACLs) so that I can define access controls to the resource by 'each user', and what the privileges are for that 'resource'.    *Spike Scope:*  ** Review customer use cases and come up with design specs  ** Identify the best approach that fits XD runtime  ** Identify scope for DSL and UI   ** Document next steps and phases  
R1965. Create a load-generator source module that  will generate messages and dispatch messages to a XD stream.      
R1966. Create a Sink that can capture the results of the messages sent and log the number of messages received per a configured interval in seconds.
R1967. Expecting <module-name> in module configuration is brittle, especially in conjunction with module upload command which permits the module to be registered under a different name.  The convention should be dropped in favor of any file name. This requires at most one foo.xml, foo.groovy, and/or foo.properties in the top level config folder. It is an exception if multiples are found.   Accepting any file name provides the most flexibility without sacrificing backward compatibility (except in rare cases in which a module developer may have violated the multiple xml or properties files condition). An alternate approach requiring a well known file name such as 'spring-module' were rejected over concerns that it would break any existing custom module implementations.
R1968. As a performance tester, I'd like to investigate why there's high CPU startup time for both admin and container servers. Perhaps profiling would assist isolating the bottlenecks.     *Scope:*  * Identify the bottlenecks  * Document reasons  * List pros/cons
R1969. We would want to upgrade SI Kafka extension dependency to inherit the refactoring work with Kafka simple consumer API.

R1972. As a CF user, I'd like to have the ability to override the HDFS location so that I can change where the custom module _uber-jar_ can be stored and retrieved. 
R1973. As a CF user, I'd like to have the ability to override the YARN config location so that I can change where the custom module _uber-jar_ can be stored and retrieved. 
R1974. As a user, I'd like to have the option to stop an existing Spark job so that I can clean-up resources at the time of completion. 
R1975. As an developer, I'd like to have a similar approach to creating reactor based stream processor as with Spark and RxJava.  A plugin should allow a reactor processor module to specify the bare minimum to work, e.g. the processor class.    Explore how additional configuration can be achieved with well known module option commands.    
R1976. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to Reactor 2.0 RC1 release so that we can synchronize with stable dependencies.
R1977. The scope is to use this as a bucket for any local test failures. Let's have them accounted in this story and fix as applicable.

R1981. As a developer, I'd like to isolate the Hadoop tests in a different project so that the DIRT project doesn't have to depend upon, thus eliminating the incorrect CP file generation in eclipse. 
R1982. Admin on YARN simply fails because messagebus libs are not copied in place during a build.    Already tried and simple fix is for gradle/build-dist.gradle:    {code}  task copyYarnMessageBusLibs(type: Copy) {    from "$rootDir/lib/messagebus"    into "$buildDir/dist/spring-xd-yarn/xd-yarn/lib/messagebus"  }  {code}    and execute it together with copyMessageBusLibs task.
R1983. Currently yarn runtime needs two yarn appmaster instances(one for admins, one for containers). SHDP's container grouping added functionality to run different type of containers within a same appmaster.    Beyond this, container grouping will also give more functionality like ramping containers up/down on-demand, creating groups with different settings dynamically and restarting failed containers.
R1984. MongoDb driver is present on DIRT's classpath, while it should not (should be present on mongo-related modules though).  This is blocked by the shortcoming described here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1116
R1985. As a developer, I'd like to have acceptance test coverage for XD + YARN on EC2 so that I can verify simple XD features running on YARN on every build cycle.
R1986. Since the messagebus refactoring, we now see     {noformat}  15:43:06,379 1.1.0.M2  WARN xdbus.foo.0-1 support.DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper - skipping header 'amqp_deliveryMode' since it is not of expected type [class org.springframework.amqp.core.MessageDeliveryMode], it is [class org.springframework.amqp.core.MessageDeliveryMode]  {noformat}    When using a rabbit transport and a rabbit sink (the sink Spring AMQP is in its own classloader).
R1987. Create an 2.6 Yarn Environment on EC2 for which XD can be deployed for acceptance tests.
R1988. The data that is entering a broadcast stream can only occur from one thread at a time to prevent race conditions inside the stream implementation.  The current handler shares a single broadcast stream.  Change to create a new one per thread usage.
R1989. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade _reactor-ip_ and _syslog_ modules to Reactor 2.0 so that we can sync up with the latest release.

R1992. Gemfire sink module accepts useLocator, host and port properties but this only allows to use one locator at a time.    We have a need to use the Gemfire sink SpringXD Module in our Seamless access project that we want to go live in Q1.  The Version of SpringXD we planned on using is 1.1    However we need HA and we need to connect to a cluster with multiple locators. Problem is this isn’t supported yet in SpringXD.    We have used multiple locators in many projects in EMC and we don’t want to revert back to a situation where we have to put virtual IPs in front of locators just for SpringXD.    Ref to the SpringXD docs found in 1.0.3 and 1.1.0GA versions:    “The locator option is mostly intended for integration with an existing GemFire installation in which the cache servers are configured to use locators in accordance with best practice. While GemFire supports configuration of multiple locators for failover, this is currently not supported in XD. However, using a single virtual IP backed by hardware routers for failover has proven to be an effective and simpler alternative.�?    
R1993. When using HDFS sink with ildeTimeout and rollover options in stream definition we have noticed that idleTimeout does not give you a flexibility when you would prefer a file to rollover after specific time regardless of the activity/inactivity of the file.

R1996. Currently xd-shell script packaged in Spring XD dist creates spring-shell.log file in invocation directory.   When xd-shell is added to $PATH user will usually invoke the script from many directories leaving log files all over the file system.

R1998. *Expected*   1. Create MYTABLE table with DATE or TIMESTAMP column MYTIME 2. Create a stream ending with {code}... | object-to-json | jdbc --tableName=MYTABLE ...{code} 3. Send a message with payload being a Java object that has a property myTime of type java.util.Date 4. Message payload is inserted into MYTABLE table, date is correctly stored in MYTIME column.  *Actual*  4. Exception is thrown from JDBC sink which attempts to bind a long into MYTIME column.  *Root cause*  JDBC sink uses *org.springframework.xd.jdbc.JdbcMessagePayloadTransformer* class to deserialize JSON payload into Map which will later be used to bind parameters into java.sql.PreparedStatement.  Unfortunately JdbcMessagePayloadTransformer, and MessageTransformingHandler which is calling it, doesn't respect *json\_\_TypeId\_\_* message header so information about Java types is lost. Other Spring XD components serialize java.util.Date as Unix timestamp e.g. object-to-json transformer. JDBC sink will deserialize the date as java.lang.Long and later attempt to bind incorrect type to query parameter.  In case of GemFire XD following exception will be thrown during query parameter binding phase: {code} com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.shared.common.sanity.AssertFailure: ASSERT FAILED Number of parameters expected for message id 22005 (3) does not match number of arguments received (2)   com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.shared.common.sanity.SanityManager.ASSERT(SanityManager.java:239)   com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.shared.common.i18n.MessageUtil.formatMessage(MessageUtil.java:245)   com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.shared.common.i18n.MessageUtil.getCompleteMessage(MessageUtil.java:151)   com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.shared.common.i18n.MessageUtil.getCompleteMessage(MessageUtil.java:191)   com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.shared.common.i18n.MessageUtil.getCompleteMessage(MessageUtil.java:107)   com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.client.am.SqlException.<init>(SqlException.java:184)   com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.client.am.PreparedStatement$PossibleTypes.throw22005Exception(PreparedStatement.java:4007)   com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.client.am.PreparedStatement.setLong(PreparedStatement.java:843)   com.pivotal.gemfirexd.internal.client.am.PreparedStatement.setObject(PreparedStatement.java:1688)   org.springframework.jdbc.core.StatementCreatorUtils.setValue(StatementCreatorUtils.java:402)   org.springframework.jdbc.core.StatementCreatorUtils.setParameterValueInternal(StatementCreatorUtils.java:235)   org.springframework.jdbc.core.StatementCreatorUtils.setParameterValue(StatementCreatorUtils.java:150)   org.springframework.jdbc.core.PreparedStatementCreatorFactory$PreparedStatementCreatorImpl.setValues(PreparedStatementCreatorFactory.java:300)   org.springframework.jdbc.core.PreparedStatementCreatorFactory$PreparedStatementCreatorImpl.createPreparedStatement(PreparedStatementCreatorFactory.java:252)   org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate.execute(JdbcTemplate.java:638)   org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate.update(JdbcTemplate.java:909)   org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate.update(JdbcTemplate.java:933)   org.springframework.jdbc.core.namedparam.NamedParameterJdbcTemplate.update(NamedParameterJdbcTemplate.java:313)   org.springframework.integration.jdbc.JdbcMessageHandler.executeUpdateQuery(JdbcMessageHandler.java:130)   org.springframework.integration.jdbc.JdbcMessageHandler.handleMessageInternal(JdbcMessageHandler.java:112)   org.springframework.integration.handler.AbstractMessageHandler.handleMessage(AbstractMessageHandler.java:78) 	... 372 more {code}

R2011. As a user deploying XD on YARN I need a convenient way to get info like the admin port for my current deployment.    Best way, for now, would be to add an info command to the xd-yarn script.    With the latest changes the admin server runs on a random port when we deploy to YARN. In order for the user to connect they would have to query Zookeeper. This is inconvenient.
R2012. Update the supplied PostgreSQL JDBC Driver to the latest version (9.3-1102 - 2014-07-10), the current supplied version is from 2012.     In our particular use case the latest driver allows use of the JDBC connection.unwrap feature which gives access to the underlying connection from a pooled connection which in turn enables use of the postgres copyManager.copyIn functionality which can speed up batch inserts in a batch process.     See http://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html

The *org.springframework.xd.module.options.mixins.ScriptMixin* options class shipped with XD 1.0.3 refers to *script* rather than *location* however the XML configuration still references *$\{location\}* in the service activator:  {noformat} 	<service-activator output-channel="output" input-channel="input"> 		<int-groovy:script location="${location}" script-variable-generator="variableGenerator" refresh-check-delay="60"/> 	</service-activator> {noformat}  Creating a stream using the old *location* argument no longer works obviously:  {noformat} xd:>stream create myJobArchiveTrigger --definition "tap:job:myJob.job > script --location=job-status.groovy --variables='tgtStatus=COMPLETED' > queue:job:archiveJob" --deploy Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Error with option(s) for module script of type processor     location: option named 'location' is not supported {noformat}  Creating the same stream using *--script* reports success at the shell prompt but results in an error in the container/admin logs:  {noformat} Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder 'location' in string value "${location}" {noformat}  Working around this by overriding the XML setting in our deployment:  {noformat} 	<service-activator output-channel="output" input-channel="input"> 		<int-groovy:script location="${script}" script-variable-generator="variableGenerator" refresh-check-delay="60"/> 	</service-activator> {noformat}
R2016. As an developer, I'd like to have a similar approach to creating reactor based stream processor as with Spark and RxJava.  A plugin should allow a reactor processor module to specify the bare minimum to work, e.g. the processor class.    Explore how additional configuration can be achieved with well known module option commands.    
R2017. In order to decrease CI build issues, we should checkin bower dependencies.   See: http://addyosmani.com/blog/checking-in-front-end-dependencies/

R2026. Currently any properties files located in the ${xd.config.home}/ directory are not included in the config directory provided by the yarn deployment. And thus modules are pulling props from the  spring-xd-yarn-1.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.zip file.   We need to include these property files in the config dir.  
R2027. As a user, I'd like to have Google's [Protocol Buffer|https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/] codec option so that I can serialize/deserialize objects based on its native specifications.
R2028. As a tester, I'd like to add test coverage for "complex objects" such protocol buffers, any object with nested variables or a tree of objects so that I can evaluate and document the performance characteristics.
R2029. Currently, `ensureTopicCreated` will invoke the creation of the topic on the brokers, however, the calls is not blocking. So, before proceeding, we should make sure that the metadata is readable (therefore propagated)
R2030. When setting the management.port in the servers.yml all deployments should use the port specified.  Currently only admin is updated, the containers are still using 0.
R2031. Looks like there is a bit of technical debt in *ZooKeeperStreamRepository*. Additionally there is not a single test for this class, yet. However, testability looks tricky.

R2034. The following timeout options should be added to our configuration file:    | session timeout | the number of milliseconds before the ZooKeeper session times out |  | connection timeout | the number of milliseconds before a connection to a ZooKeeper server times out |  | retry wait period | number of milliseconds to wait before attempting a connection after a failed connection |  | max retries | number of times to attempt a connection after a failed connection |    
R2035. The deployment guide https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Deployment should have instructions on turning on verbose gc for production applications.    The gc log tends to be verbose so running it in development is not desirable. However having the gc log in production is very helpful for troubleshooting slow/unresponsive applications.
R2036. Leaving the runtime running (e.g. as singlenode) ends up in permgen errors
R2037. Configure Redis Cluster with Sentinal v 2.8.19.   Verify fail over, experiment with settings.  Useful reference https://code.flickr.net/2014/07/31/redis-sentinel-at-flickr/    All analytics test cases should be run as well as test that deploy streams that make use of redis analytics.   There might be some minor code changes required as mentioned in the flickr article.
R2038. As a developer, I'd like to use Ambari plugin so that I can provision, manage, and monitor Spring XD cluster using the same tool I use for Hadoop clusters.
R2039. In *ZooKeeperStreamRepository#findAllInRange()* the parameters  * boolean fromInclusive * boolean toInclusive  Don't have any effect (implicitly true)  Are they needed? Do we need to support it?
R2040. In cases where I re-run a job, and during the job execution the percentage complete will tally the total runtime of the current execution and all previous executions. See the attached image.
R2041. As a user, I'd like to refer to the wiki so that I can create a job with 'partitions' that in turn expects _tableName_ and _columns_ be explicitly included in the job definition.     It is also beneficial to call-out _sql_ and _tableName_ metadata options are mutually exclusive. Following logic in _JdbcHdfsOptionsMetadata_ needs documented.    {code:java}  @AssertTrue(message = "Use ('tableName' AND 'columns') when using partition column")  boolean isPartitionedWithTableName() {  	if (StringUtils.hasText(partitionColumn)) {  		return StringUtils.hasText(tableName) && !StringUtils.hasText(sql);  	}  	else {  		return true;  	}  }  {code}    
R2042. As a user, I'd like to either use _sql_ or _tableName_ options so that I can build a partitioned job with _where_ clause and strict table-column combo respectively. 
R2043. Multiple threads invoke the shell processor result in I/O errors and/or data corruption. send() and receive() should be synchronized. 
R2044. The spring-xd-[version]-shell.zip distribution zip doesn't include the lib/hadoop26 directory and libraries, so we get the following exception when starting the shell:    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/conf/Configuration  
R2045. In order to run Acceptance tests in their current state there had to be * changes to the code  ** Set the location of the data node for the hdfs tests. (because the data nodes were no located with the master.) ** disable the copying of batch basic because we did not know the container location. * Had to configure tests by hand so that we could identify the: ** admin port (with new features we should be able to write code to find it.  Should be able to set it but we had a problem.  Possible yarn bug) ** JMX Port ( We could set it for the master but not the container this was a Yarn deployBug ) ** Where the build was deployed on the container node, so we could copy the batch-basic test.   
R2046. Hey Guys,  Im trying to run WordCount example in kerberized cluster with the attached job configuration. The job upload the test file to the HDFS without problems but it fails in wordcount step. I am running the example on singlenode and  I configured the config/hadoop.properties file for shell and container with kerberos setting such as https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Hadoop-Kerberos.  The error log is attached.  Thanks in advance for the help. Regards
R2047. Currently, the ModuleFactory needs to know about `SparkStreamingDriverModule` to create the spark streaming module. It is for this reason, the spring-xd-module has direct dependency on spark streaming. We need to refactor this code so that there is no direct dependency on spark streaming for spring-xd-module and subsequently spring-xd-dirt.
R2048. Line 295 has 2 dashes instead of 3.  There is no effect on XD unless the XD extensions block is uncommented.

R2049. For kerberos and other security related settings we use keys like 'spring.hadoop.userPrincipal' mentioned in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Hadoop-Kerberos. However when we added boot config props to shdp, we used a sub keys like 'spring.hadoop.security.userPrincipal'.    It'd be good if we'd fix these to be same in both XD and SHDP not to cause confusion.
R2050. Currently, the org.springframework.xd.dirt.server.SharedServerContextConfiguration will load  everything that matches the  `"classpath*:" + ConfigLocations.XD_CONFIG_ROOT + "bus/*.xml"` path.   In a normal (i.e. production) environment, there are no conflicts, since only one jar containing message bus definitions is ever on the class path.   However, during testing, *all* the projects containing bus definitions are on the class path, which leads to potential conflicts.
R2051. See {{RedisSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests}} etc.
R2052. The scope is to research the available options to provide request/reply support for Kafka.     * Document findings  * POCs    Previous Desc:  The bindRequestor and bindReplier methods of the message bus need to be implemented.
R2053. As a user, I'd like to migrate from 1.0 to 1.1 and be able to port my custom modules so that I can operationalize existing data pipelines and also take advantage of latest XD features.
R2054. If a stream foo has messages in its queue when it is destroyed and another stream named foo is created of similar structure those messages will be delivered to sink.  This is seen when twitterstream runs prior to hdfssink test.  The twitters stream data is written to hdfs instead of the trigger data that was intended. The solution is to give hdfstest its own unique name instead of the default ec2test3 name.
R2055. Use latest version, might need to exclude version from other dependencies, e.g. SI, in build-common.gradle.
R2056. Currently, ModuleDeploymentWriter uses default timeout 30s which can not be overridden. We need to make this configurable.
R2057. As a user, I'd like to refer to a Pig script/job sample so that I can use that as a reference to integrate Pig jobs in XD.
R2058. The max-messages-per-poll property of the poller used in the file source is not exposed and cannot be configured. I think it has the default value of 1 in this configuration:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/modules/source/file/config/file.xml#L18  As a result it is not possible to configure the file source to pick all new files available in a single poll.  This is a limitation in fast file ingestion scenarios.
R2059. The XD on YARN section of the docs needs to be updated with the "xd-yarn admininfo" command for detecting the ports used by admin servers.
R2060. At this time Kafka Message bus does not support jobs but we still need to run acceptance tests for streams.  Thus we need to exclude Jobs from the acceptance tests when using Kafka Message Bus. 
R2061. As a user, I'd like to build XD in Windows machine so that I can develop, test,  and contributed to OSS.
R2062. As a developer, I'd like to run acceptance test coverage in Windows so that I can evaluate XD functionalities.    The scope is to provision Windows image in EC2 and run acceptance test in the environment. Potentially also try to create this as CI build.
R2063. As a developer, I'd like to build _Spark Streaming_ as data processors in XD so that we can demonstrate some of the capabilities.    *Implement using:*  * Java / Java Lambdas  * Scala
R2064. As a PM, I'd like to have the copyright message in the reference guide (PDF) updated to include 2015 instead of 2014. 
R2065. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to Kafka's SI GA release so that I can sync -up with the latest bits.     The scope is to backport Kafka XD changes to SI Kafka and then upgrade to the GA release.
R2066. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to SHDP GA release so that I can sync -up with the latest bits. 
R2067. Hey Guys,  We are currently trying to connect Hive by spring-xd to create a table.  Unfortunatly we are not able to do it. We are using the attached job configuration (hive.xml) trying to connect by Hive Thrift Client with the following configuration:  <hadoop:hive-client-factory host="hive_host" port="10000" /> <hadoop:hive-tasklet id="hive-script">    <hadoop:script>      USE TESTING;      DROP TABLE IF EXITS testHiveBatchTable;       CREATE TABLE testHiveBatchTable (key int, value string);    </hadoop:script> </hadoop:hive-tasklet>  For Some reason spring XD is not finding the TTransportException class. The full log is in the singlenode_hivequery.log  file  attached. After that we tried uploading all the dependencies to the lib folder of the job, but now we are facing problems with log4j (full log is in singlenode_hivequery2.log attached) and we are unable to deploy the job in any of the two cases. Please,  Could you help us to solve this problem?   Thanks in advance.
R2068. We need the ability to have bamboo provision a Windows instance on EC2 and launch a XD build.   Capture the results of the XD Build and report back to Bamboo Success or failure. If the build is successful, shutdown the EC2 Windows instance.  Else leave it running so someone can diagnose the problem.

R2082. As a user, I'd like to see the 'date' in logs so that I can troubleshoot issues that had occurred on a specific day and time.    Property that needs adjusted:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/config/xd-container-logger.properties#L11
R2083. Submitting jobs that submit YARN MR tasks on Cloudera 5.3.0    - job fails when submitting the YARN app         java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/common/io/LimitInputStream    - this is from Guava and that class was removed starting with v. 15.0    - I can get around this by including guava-14.0.1.jar in lib/cdh5 (not sure if this breaks something else)  
R2084. Running Sqoop job against non Apache Hadoop installation    - YARN app fails         Error: Could not find or load main class org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster    - Need to be able to set yarn.application.classpath for any distro that doesn't use the Hadoop defult classpath (Cloudera, Hortonworks, Pivotal HD)
R2085. see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2454
R2086. Gradle 2.x is required for the latest Sonar version (sonar.spring.io)    We may need to wait for a fix in Groovy itself (2.4.1) - Please see the following links for details:    * http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/after_upgrade_gradle_to_2_0_version_the_maven_pom_not_support_build_property    * http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-7023    
R2087. As a developer, I'd like to run Kafka tests with Kafka Server as a separate running process so that I can improve build experience. 
R2088. As a developer, I'd like the {{publish-maven.gradle}} script to use values for dependencies (e.g. Spring Boot and {{hadoop-common}}) from our central dependency list (in this case {{dependencies.properties}}) so that I don't have to update them manually anymore.
R2089. Currently, when the module doesn't need to go through message bus binding, the Module interface provides 'shouldBind()` method to return false.  The shouldBind() is being used in other place where ModuleTypeConversionPlugin is excluded for spark streaming modules.  We need a better approach to refactor this. Also, see the discussion here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1438#discussion_r24150937
R2090. Can revert part of the commit that went into upgrading to reactor 2.0    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1342/files  
R2091. Having problems testing against the Sandbox 2.2. We need to set the following properties:    yarn.application.classpath  yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts  mapreduce.application.classpath  mapreduce.application.framework.path    
R2092. As a developer, I want to have to run Kafka tests on an external broker, so that I reduce the footprint of the build process. 
R2093. As a developer, I'd like to review the current sonar violations so that I can fix the relevant and update the irrelevant ones as invalid.
R2094. remove spark and hadoop requirements from spring-xd-module-parent and gradle module plugin
R2095. As a developer, I'd like to build _Spark_ batch job sample so that we can demonstrate some of the distributed data computation capabilities.
R2096. As a developer, I'd like to build data pipeline using _Kafka_ as as message bus in XD so that we can demonstrate some of the capabilities.  *Use case to consider:* * Log aggregation and analysis * Lambda architecture ** how to avoid code duplication ** how to eliminate tight coupling of business logic ** how Kafka can be used for reliable reprocessing  
R2097. As a developer, I'd like to build batch sample using _Sqoop_ so that we can demonstrate some of the capabilities.  *Use cases to consider:* * JDBC to HDFS * HDFS to JDBC 
R2098. As a consequence,   * change gradle script regarding generation of documentation  * remove pushGeneratedDocs task, etc  * remove link rewriting that is no longer needed 
R2099. See original report here https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/1300  "I've created a module with a custom Metric, Handler and Repository patterned after the AggregateCounter but then it appears that there doesn't seem to be a way to add anything to the Admin Context.  The diagram at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Extending-XD shows the Plugin Context as a sibling to the Admin Context which seems to verify my fears.  It would be convenient to be able to add custom Metrics/Controllers/Repositories into the Admin Context so that they can be accessed through the same REST api as the other Metrics."
R2100. {code}  logger.error("Failed to deliver message; retries exhausted; message sent to queue 'ERRORS:name'",										context.getLastThrowable());  {code}    Should be:    {code}  logger.error("Failed to deliver message; retries exhausted; message sent to queue 'ERRORS:" + name + '",										context.getLastThrowable());  {code}    So the actual name is logged.  
R2101. Currently, when the spark streaming ModuleExecutor iterate over the RDD partitions, it converts all the items to spring Message. If the item itself is of Message type (the conversion happened at the spark streaming processor implementation), then this is not needed. We need to add a check to see if the item is of Message type.
R2102. We need to use getMessageBuilderFactory(beanFactory) to initialize MessageBuilder in Spark Streaming module executor. Please see the discussion: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1454/files#r24367825 , 
R2103. The error below appears to be a concurrency issue related to multiple classloaders loading the same spring XML resource.  The root cause needs further investigation, but it causes intermittent test failures in JobCommandsTests.  see https://build.spring.io/browse/XD-JDK8-1375  java.lang.AssertionError: java.lang.AssertionError: Failure.

R2104. In `org.springframework.xd.dirt.stream.KafkaSingleNodeStreamDeploymentIntegrationTests#verifyOnDemandQueues`, when testing the queue partitions for content, the read is assumed to start at offset 0.    This is incorrect, because the topics may exist already, especially in a CI environment
R2105. Update Hadoop, Spark, Mongo, gemfire, and ubuntu to latest versions for both CI  and Utility instances.    
R2106. Currently all message bus implementations are removed from the runtime classpath and loaded on demand from the file system according to the transport setting. Custom module projects that include in container testing must install messagebus-local on the local file system. This is currently configured as a task for module build scripts. This is also a dependency for testing in the IDE and developers need to execute the build task or configure the messagebus manually. Embedding the local MB for the singlenode application (local is not a valid transport for distributed) eliminates this step.
R2107. As a field engineer, I'd like to have a comparison of Storm examples in Spring XD so that it is easy to relate from implementation standpoint. 
R2108. As a field engineer, I'd like to have a comparison of Spark Streaming examples in Spring XD so that it is easy to relate from implementation standpoint.  
R2109. As a PM, I'd like to have the Smart Grid demo (from s1-2014) ported into Spring XD samples repo.
R2110. As a developer, I'd like to create a example to demonstrate JDBC to HDFS data movement.
R2111. As a stream definer, when defining a stream ending with a file sink, I would like to have more flexibility for naming the file.    Add an alternative {{--nameExpression}} option, allowing complete control over the {{finename-generator-expression}} attribute.    See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28466477/issue-with-file-sink-and-filename-expression/28467069#28467069
R2112. As a user, I'd like to clean up message bus resources associated with the stream so that when the stream is destroyed so does the coupled queues/topics.
R2113. As a user, I'd like to clean-up stale queues/topics associated with the stream so when the stream gets destroyed I can clean-up resources. 
R2114. I'm running a jdbchdfs job with 8 partitions and 2 containers. Some steps complete ok while some (3-4 on average) fail with a connection pool error (see below). This happens with a decent size table (1.8M rows).    I tried two different databases - Oracle 11g on a separate server and MySQL running locally where the XD containers where running. Same pattern with both databases.    {code}  2015-02-13 12:21:33,436 1.1.0.RELEASE ERROR inbound.files3.0-redis:queue-inbound-channel-adapter1 step.AbstractStep - Encountered an error executing step

R2117. The partitionResultsTimeout is set to 300000 as default (5min). This is way to short for long running steps. We should increase this default.
R2118. As a user, I'd like to have the option of editing the deployed/undeployed stream so that I don't have to destroy to just change any deployment property.
R2119. Stumbled upon this while having Hadoop daemons running, but simple way to repoduce:  {noformat} nc -lp 9000  stream create foo --definition "http | log" --deploy ==> all seems ok  http post --data hello ==> Error 500, rightfully so {noformat}
R2120. To be added in AbstractMetricsController, as well as the various shell commands ("counter all delete", etc...)
R2121. The property "xd.messagebus.kafka.offsetStoreTopic" was added to Kafka message bus which is not updated to Spark streaming message bus properties that will be transferred to spark cluster for streaming module deployment.   We also need a better approach to re-use the message bus properties so that we don't have to update the properties in Connection Property Names.
R2122. The spark streaming processor module emits the following exception when there are more messages in the RDD partitions:    015-02-17 12:45:02,026 1.2.0.SNAP ERROR Executor task launch worker-2 executor.Executor - Exception in task 0.0 in stage 56.0 (TID 142)  org.springframework.messaging.MessageDeliveryException: Dispatcher has no subscribers for channel 'output'.; nested exception is org.springframework.integration.MessageDispatchingException: Dispatcher has no subscribers    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractSubscribableChannel.doSend(AbstractSubscribableChannel.java:81)    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractMessageChannel.send(AbstractMessageChannel.java:277)    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractMessageChannel.send(AbstractMessageChannel.java:239)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.plugins.spark.streaming.MessageBusSender.send(MessageBusSender.java:105)    org.springframework.xd.spark.streaming.java.ModuleExecutor$1$1.call(ModuleExecutor.java:80)    org.springframework.xd.spark.streaming.java.ModuleExecutor$1$1.call(ModuleExecutor.java:55)    org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDDLike$$anonfun$foreachPartition$1.apply(JavaRDDLike.scala:195)    org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDDLike$$anonfun$foreachPartition$1.apply(JavaRDDLike.scala:195)    org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$foreachPartition$1.apply(RDD.scala:790)    org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$foreachPartition$1.apply(RDD.scala:790)    org.apache.spark.SparkContext$$anonfun$runJob$4.apply(SparkContext.scala:1353)    org.apache.spark.SparkContext$$anonfun$runJob$4.apply(SparkContext.scala:1353)    org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask.runTask(ResultTask.scala:61)    org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:56)    org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:200)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)  Caused by: org.springframework.integration.MessageDispatchingException: Dispatcher has no subscribers    org.springframework.integration.dispatcher.UnicastingDispatcher.doDispatch(UnicastingDispatcher.java:107)    org.springframework.integration.dispatcher.UnicastingDispatcher.dispatch(UnicastingDispatcher.java:97)    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractSubscribableChannel.doSend(AbstractSubscribableChannel.java:77)  	... 17 more  2015-02-17 12:45:02,032 1.2.0.SNAP  WARN task-result-getter-1 scheduler.TaskSetManager - Lost task 0.0 in stage 56.0 (TID 142, localhost): org.springframework.messaging.MessageDeliveryException: Dispatcher has no subscribers for channel 'output'.; nested exception is org.springframework.integration.MessageDispatchingException: Dispatcher has no subscribers    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractSubscribableChannel.doSend(AbstractSubscribableChannel.java:81)    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractMessageChannel.send(AbstractMessageChannel.java:277)    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractMessageChannel.send(AbstractMessageChannel.java:239)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.plugins.spark.streaming.MessageBusSender.send(MessageBusSender.java:105)    org.springframework.xd.spark.streaming.java.ModuleExecutor$1$1.call(ModuleExecutor.java:80)    org.springframework.xd.spark.streaming.java.ModuleExecutor$1$1.call(ModuleExecutor.java:55)    org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDDLike$$anonfun$foreachPartition$1.apply(JavaRDDLike.scala:195)    org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDDLike$$anonfun$foreachPartition$1.apply(JavaRDDLike.scala:195)    org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$foreachPartition$1.apply(RDD.scala:790)    org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$foreachPartition$1.apply(RDD.scala:790)    org.apache.spark.SparkContext$$anonfun$runJob$4.apply(SparkContext.scala:1353)    org.apache.spark.SparkContext$$anonfun$runJob$4.apply(SparkContext.scala:1353)    org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask.runTask(ResultTask.scala:61)    org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:56)    org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:200)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)  Caused by: org.springframework.integration.MessageDispatchingException: Dispatcher has no subscribers    org.springframework.integration.dispatcher.UnicastingDispatcher.doDispatch(UnicastingDispatcher.java:107)    org.springframework.integration.dispatcher.UnicastingDispatcher.dispatch(UnicastingDispatcher.java:97)    org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractSubscribableChannel.doSend(AbstractSubscribableChannel.java:77)  	... 17 more  
R2123. Upload payload conversion demo such that a user can use the module upload feature against the sample.
R2124. As a user, I'd like to include the deployment manifest from the file so that I don't have spend time typing as "inline properties".
R2125. During testing for Spring XD for PivotalCF we create, deploy, use, undeploy and destroy many streams. Each stream generates {{tmp}} directories (I think 2, one for source, one for sink) in the xd-admin VM's {{/tmp}} directory, e.g.    {noformat}  dummy-module4635787551932601017sinkredis  dummy-module252960009195893204sourcehttp  {noformat}    These {{tmp}} directories are not being cleared up, so our system has hit the inode limit of 32768 files for a volume:    {noformat}  Filesystem     Inodes IUsed  IFree IUse% Mounted on  /dev/loop0      32768 32768      0  100% /tmp  {noformat}    This causes a Java {{IOException}}, the immediately relevant part of which appears to be:    {noformat}  [Caught] exception while handling a request  Feb 18 09:06:06 10.85.30.142-2 xd-admin-partition-default_az_guid-0:  [java.lang.RuntimeException] java.io.IOException: No space left on device  Feb 18 09:06:06 10.85.30.142-2 xd-admin-partition-default_az_guid-0:  []    at org.springframework.xd.module.ModuleDefinitions.dummy(ModuleDefinitions.java:81)  {noformat}    This causes the test system to fail entirely.
R2126. Since the refactoring of the module registry that does not "look inside" a module, it can't know that the scripts directory is not a module.  Everything that is a direct child of source, processor, sink, job should be a module archive. Everything else supporting that should be moved out, e.g. in modules/common
R2127. XD can not find the custom modules directory after Setting the xd.customModule.home in the windows environment   Deployment * xd-singlenode (embedded zookeeper) * Java 8 * Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 r2  Steps to reproduce:  1) Start xd-singlenode 2) Start Shell 3) Build either the payload-conversion or rss-feed-source from the spring-xd-samples 4) use the shell to execute a module upload for the custom module (rss-feed-source, payload-conversion) 5) verify it uploaded xd:>module info processor:myTupleProcessor 6) stop xd single node 7) From the command line execute set xd.customModule.home=[path to your custom modules] i.e. C:\project\spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE\xd\custom-modules 8) restart xd-singlenode 9) execute module info processor:myTupleProcessor 10) you will get the following error {noformat} Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Could not find module with name 'myTupleProcessor' and type 'processor' {noformat}
R2128. As a field engineer, I'd like to have reference architectures built on Spring XD so that I can use that as reference building POCs. The scope is to get the raw domain specific ideas captured as first step.  
R2129. Currently, the local message bus has couple of properties "queueSize" and "polling". But these properties can not be configurable via servers.yml.  Also, the property prefix needs to align with other message bus properties.
R2130. Thanks to INT-3624, we don't need our specific class anymore
R2131. As a user, I'd like to have an optional _trace_ as inline deployment properties for _stream_ so that I can declare which _module_ in the stream needs to be traced for logging or notifications. This gives the flexibility to track the stage progress between individual modules.  *Example:*  {code:xml} xd:> stream create foo "http | log"  xd:> stream deploy foo --properties "module.http.trace,module.log.trace"  (or)  xd:> stream deploy foo --properties "module.*.trace" {code}  Wildcard wiretap config: http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-channels-section.html#channel-global-wiretap
R2132. As a user, I'd like to have an optional  arbitrary "side channels" created so that when creating a module channels other than the primary stream channels (input, output) could be added to the bus (i.e. creating a tap channel *within* a flow). The optional "side channels" can be used to trace/track module progress.
R2133. There are cases where hdfs-outbound-channel-adapter (from spring-xd-hadoop module) will keep a broken datawriter's stream open.  For example if the underlying HDFS stream throws a RemoteException (ie. some hadoop error occurred) there's no mitigation. Subsequent writes will always fail.  The MessageHandler could potentially try to close and re-open the stream or trigger a rollover strategy to occur (creating a new stream).
R2134. The configuration for the redis sink must be provided for explicitly instead of falling back to values defined in servers.yml.  The default behavior configuration should be address in a manner consistent with the default behavior of module config for rabbit source/sink, jdbc sink....
R2135. As a developer, I'd like to study the taxi trips based on a stream of trip reports from New York City so that I can evaluate event-based systems in the context of real-time analytics using Spring XD.    [Challenge Details|http://www.debs2015.org/call-grand-challenge.html]
R2136. The scope is to address the sub-tasks linked with this story.  
R2137. As a developer, I'd like to benchmark Rabbit performance so that I can use the results as reference to setup XD cluster.
R2138. The spark streaming message bus receiver isn't reliable yet. The receiver needs to handle data loss in case of worker node that has it running.    We currently handle the driver failure automatically by re-deploying spark streaming module. But, this is about the data loss when the worker node dies.    Please see the documents here:    https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/15/improved-driver-fault-tolerance-and-zero-data-loss-in-spark-streaming.html    http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-custom-receivers.html
R2139. I am trying to create a simple JDBC|FILE stream with Split=0 at the jdbc source. following is the DSL  stream create --name test --definition "jdbc --fixedDelay=5 --split=0 --query='select * from top_movie_companies'|file --dir=/tmp --suffix=xd --name=test" --deploy  It throws  org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from type java.util.ArrayList<?> to type java.lang.String   org.springframework.integration.util.AbstractExpressionEvaluator.evaluateExpression(AbstractExpressionEvaluator.java:138)  It works fine when I use LOG sink instead of FILE.   I am assuming that if LOG sink works with JDBC then file should be similar. The converter should be registered out of the box.  It could be something basic I am missing as I'm relatively new to XD.
R2140. Hey Guys,    I'm trying to use a SqoopTasklet but for some reason it is not getting the hadoop configuration. In the attached sqoop job configuration using the sqooprunner class directly works without problems but the SqoopTasklet is not getting the correct configuration throwing kerberos authentication problems (see singlenode.log).  Could please you guys help me to solve this problem?    Thanks in advance.  Regards,
R2141. Currently new modules can be installed via the module upload command, but for this to work one needs to  build the artifacts beforehand.    It would be great to have support for installing new XD modules from maven coordinates (e.g. from a public or   controlled maven repository).  With this one would make it easy to consume community modules without much hassle.    This could also serve as some kind of starting ground for some "special solution packages" that provides support  for, c.f. natural language processing (via a bunch of jars that contain the modules for language detection, entity detection, sentiment analysis, topic clustering) etc. that could be consumed via some kind of .bom (bill of materials) dependency like:    module install "pivotal:toolkits:nlp"
R2142. See discussion at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28551506/spring-xd-jms-message-bus-with-jms-sink
R2143. How to reproduce:    1. Run xd-singlenode (for which setting the Spark master URL to 'local' is a requirement). Use more than 1 worker thread. e.g. {{local[4]}}    2. Deploy the word-count example    3. Create a stream  {{stream create spark-streaming-word-count --definition "http | word-count | log" --deploy}}    4. Send data  {{xd:>http post --data "a b c d e f g"}}    {{xd:>http post --data "a b c"}}    5.Observe the result    2015-02-24 15:12:46,018 1.2.0.SNAP  INFO Executor task launch worker-3 sink.spark-streaming-word-count - (e,1)  2015-02-24 15:12:46,018 1.2.0.SNAP  INFO Executor task launch worker-1 sink.spark-streaming-word-count - (d,1)  2015-02-24 15:12:46,019 1.2.0.SNAP  INFO Executor task launch worker-2 sink.spark-streaming-word-count - (b,1)  2015-02-24 15:12:46,020 1.2.0.SNAP  INFO Executor task launch worker-1 sink.spark-streaming-word-count - (g,1)  2015-02-24 15:13:40,020 1.2.0.SNAP  INFO Executor task launch worker-1 sink.spark-streaming-word-count - (a,1)  2015-02-24 15:13:40,020 1.2.0.SNAP  INFO Executor task launch worker-2 sink.spark-streaming-word-count - (b,1)  2015-02-24 15:13:40,021 1.2.0.SNAP  INFO Executor task launch worker-3 sink.spark-streaming-word-count - (c,1)    (the last three results are coming from the second invocation))    Note: there seems to be a correlation between the number of values emitted and the number of workers, as, in all the attempts, there aren't more values emitted than the number of workers.
R2144. I'd like to use the following command to define a stream in our Spring XD for PivotalCF test environment:    {code}  stream create --name test --definition "http --port=9999 | jdbc --username=spring-xd --password=spring-xd --driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver --url=jdbc:postgresql://1.2.3.4:5432/spring-xd"  {code}    I have to add the following options to the definition to make it work (otherwise I get exceptions and a failed deploy):    {code}  -validationQuery='' --validatorClassName='#{null}' --connectionProperties='' --initSQL='' --jdbcInterceptors='' --initializerScript=''   {code}    Given that they're empty anyway it seems like some or all of these should not be necessary.    _Notes_  * The validatorClassName cannot be '' like the others, it needs the null.  * Without initSQL='' stream creation fails because it can't find init_db.sql (a file I don't have in my environment), even though it won't be run anyway.
R2145. As a developer, I'd like to have the high-level description for each of the modules so that I can use the description (presumably what is captured in javadoc for the module definition) to understand the purpose of the module itself.  
R2146. As  a user, I'd like to have the description for each of the modules so that I can use it to understand the module purpose and it's capabilities (presumably what is captured in javadoc for the module definition). 
R2147. Since 1.1, {{PubSub}} channels in the {{LocalMessageBus}} run on a {{CachedThreadPoolExecutor}}.    For high volume environments, where back-pressure might occur on a {{topic:}} thread we could overwhelm the system with threads.    Add a local bus configuration to limit the thread pool used for PubSubs and queue tasks where there are no threads available.    It would be a bus-wide setting.
R2148. In xd-shell the command: {code} http post {code} gives the following output: {code} Command failed java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: One of 'file' or 'data' must be set {code}  I believe the UI should suppress the exception (just removing ' java.lang.IllegalArgumentException') would suffice).
R2149. Currently PojoCodec calls kryo.register(Class<?> type) on every ser/deser invocation. This fails with 1.1 because instances are pooled and a different instance may be used to serialize and deserialize.  See https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo#registration.  The fix is to not register classes on the fly. Classes serialized by PojoCodec will not be registered by default. This will work but is less efficient. XD should provide an easy way to register types known to be serialized on the MessageBus (passed between modules)
R2150. As a build manager, I'd like to have Spring XD RPMs published in spring.io repository so that users can directly download the bits without having to go through appsuite repo or the EULA.     *Location for 1.1.0 RELEASE:*  http://repo.spring.io/libs-release-local/org/springframework/xd/spring-xd/1.1.0.RELEASE/

R2152. Test fails in CI when the topic used by the test had its initial segment removed during cleanup.
R2153. The current implementation of partitioned job management is entirely based on message exchange over the message bus, in a request reply scenario.  This creates challenges when it comes to using certain types of transports, as well as acknowledging crashes.   To that effect, the option of using a different partitioned job coordination strategy, that relies on a distributed computing coordination mechanism such as ZooKeeper should be investigated. 
R2154. As a user, I'd like to have the description for each of the modules so that I can use it to understand the module purpose and it's capabilities (presumably what is captured in javadoc for the module definition).
R2155. Since the message-driven adapter uses a {{DMLC}}, the default behavior is to lose messages on exceptions (with the DMLC, the message is ack'd before the listener is invoked).    In order to provide recovery of such situations, the source needs to expose {{acknowledge}} so it can be set to {{transacted}}.    Or, perhaps, given that we don't expose complex configuration, the source should use a {{SimpleMessageListenerContainer}} instead (where the ack is sent after the listener is successfully invoked).  
R2156. Some modules inherit {{application.yml}} / {{servers.yml}} via a properties file in {{/config/modules}} ; others have the values defined in the {{...OptionsMetadata}} classes.  Switch all modules to use the latter technique for consistency.
R2157. In [AbstractSingleNodeNamedChannelSink|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/6bd17162c8a6da0f09f6f8809f694a060c71ecc0/spring-xd-dirt/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/dirt/test/sink/AbstractSingleNodeNamedChannelSink.java] the receive() and receivePayload() methods  are non-blocking.    Methods without timeout parameter are usually blocking and return the first message delivered to the channel (e.g. org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractPollableChannel#receive()).     Integration tests based on spring-xd-test dependency and embedded xd-singlenode are asynchronous. This makes AbstractSingleNodeNamedChannelSink receive method return null in all invocations because test thread is progressing faster than container can process the message in the background.    Would it be possible to make receive methods behave like in AbstractPollableChannel?
R2158. A LocalMessageBus in singlenode mode has several internal properties that would be useful to monitor at runtime for example via JMX: queueSize, current size of executor's queue (and others). All fields are currently write-only so it's hard to access them from custom code too. Public getters would be useful as well as an MBean exposed to JMX.
R2159. Spring XD is packaging a spring-xd-dirt dependency which aims to provide runtime libraries.    spring-xd-drit-1.1.0.RELEASE is not providing all libraries from $XD_HOME/lib. See spring-xd-dirt-vs-lib.xlsx attachment generated with "ls  $XD_HOME/lib" and "mvn dependency:list" on a module with spring-xd-module-parent parent:  - 100+ JARs are not provided  - some are provided in different versions  - some are provided but not available in $XD_HOME/lib    This forces us to add and maintain missing dependencies in our own module parent e.g. to use commons-lang3 in our code which is present in $XD_HOME/lib but is not provided by spring-xd-dirt.    Why there are so many differences between $XD_HOME/lib and spring-xd-dirt?
R2160. One can upload a module which doesn't contain "config" package with module configuration artifacts (e.g. XML, groovy, properties etc.) using the "module upload" command in Spring XD shell. During stream deployment this will result in a cryptic exception:  {code}Mar 02, 2015 10:45:48 PM org.springframework.shell.core.SimpleExecutionStrategy invoke SEVERE: Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Multiple top level module resources found :file [/opt/spring-xd/spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE/xd/config/jms-activemq.properties],file [/opt/spring-xd/spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE/xd/config/xd-container-logger.properties],file [/opt/spring-xd/spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE/xd/config/jms-hornetq.properties],file [/opt/spring-xd/spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE/xd/config/xd-singlenode-logger.properties],file [/opt/spring-xd/spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE/xd/config/xd-admin-logger.properties],file [/opt/spring-xd/spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE/xd/config/httpSSL.properties],file [/opt/spring-xd/spring-xd-1.1.0.RELEASE/xd/config/hadoop.properties]{code}  Root cause is most likely the module ClassLoader setup which delegates to parent ClassLoader which in turn scans $XD_HOME/config directory and discovers a number of properties files.  It would nice if Spring XD would validate the module during "module upload" command and prevent uploading of invalid modules.
R2161. Custom modules that use  {code} <groupId>org.springframework.xd</groupId> <artifactId>spring-xd-module-parent</artifactId> <version>1.1.0.RELEASE</version> {code}  as a parent will get a "lib" directory created in the module root source directory. This forces us to add additional ignores in version control system.  Following Maven convention all build files should be created under "target" folder so "lib" folder should be created as "target/lib".
R2162. The hdfs sink doesn't recover after error writing to hdfs.

R2163. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to SHDP 2.1.2 GA so that I can sync-up with latest features.
R2164. As a developer, I'd like to bench Kafka as message bus using in-built perf-testing producer/consumer utilities so that I can use that as a foundation to build XD use-cases and measure performance.     I'd like to reproduce baseline performance metrics as identified by the Kafka [engineering team|https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/benchmarking-apache-kafka-2-million-writes-second-three-cheap-machines].
R2165. As a developer, I'd like to document the changes to message headers so that users can refer to the troubleshooting section if there are any serialization errors when reusing the 1.0 batch-jobs in 1.1 release.    Perhaps this could be part of [troubleshooting|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Deployment#troubleshooting] section in our wiki.
R2166. The jdbchdfs job keeps the output stream open in case of error writing to HDFS. We should improve this and close it plus throw an exception.    We should also make sure the step is marked as failed instead of complete when an exception is thrown in the writer.
R2167. The documentation for RabbitMQ says to use the --address option to specify a port. We've tried --address=1.2.3.4:5678 (and also --port=5678 just in case) but have been unable to get a successful deployment. Running the same stream definition on a default port (i.e. without specifying a port) does work.

R2177. Currently it is necessary to specify mappedRequestHeaders=*  on the rabbit sink, otherwise no headers are mapped to AMQP.  This should be the default behavior.
R2178. As a build manager, I'd like to schedule CI builds for windows so that I can verify XD runtime features/functionality.    The scope is to isolate the remaining test failures; perhaps, experiment with new AMI images until we have a solid infrastructure to fix the failing tests.
R2179. As a developer, I'd like to fix the offset management with Kafka _source_ module so that I can efficiently perform fetch operation from the given offsets.
R2180. As a developer, I'd like to add a mongodb source using an xml and a property file supporting mixing in of parameters so that I can use this module to ingest data from Mongo.
R2181. As a developer, I'd like to measure performance numbers for a simple stream so that I can characterize the overall throughput.  
R2182. As a PM, I'd like to have a static _gh_pages_ to organize the collateral such as samples, tutorials, links, perf. benchmarks and ref. architectures so that it's easy for anyone to quickly get up and running on XD.
R2183. As a developer, I'd like to continue Lattice/Diego POC so that I can identify the scope, risks, and the overall design for a pluggable SPI in XD runtime.
R2184. Mask out all properties for XD-EC2
R2185. As a developer, I'd like to migrate the wiki to project repo so that it can be tagged with the code and versioned etc. 
R2186. Allow users to submit a configuration file as part of the job definition.  The configuration file should contain all job definition parameters as well as customer parameters that can be reference during runtime.  Thanks, Buelent

R2188. As a user, I'd like to add the Hadoop _namenode_ specifics in a config file so that I don't have to incur the hassle of pointing to the _namenode_ location every time I open a new DSL session, but it is automatically configured.

R2190. The build has some inconsistencies that should be taken care of.  Amongst the one I know:    * The UI project is always getting cleaned, for no apparent reason (there might have been one before), thus triggering a rebuild of everything downstream, most notably DIRT  * The “exec" task is not used anymore  * Lots of projects are getting the boot plugin applied to them. I'm not sure 100% what that plugin does, but we don't need the repackage bit for example.
R2191. When setting an active property via SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE environment variable the profile set ContainerServerApplication or AdminServerApplication is ignored.  ConfigFileApplicationListener in spring boot has an if else in the load method which skips adding the additional properties added to the StandardEnvironment if the environment variable exists.  This could be a bug for Spring Boot, but I wasn't sure if the mutual exclusion was intentional.  Additionally it would be nice to know when this feature is included in spring xd if it is a spring boot bug.
R2192. The 'partitionResultsTimeout' parameter for jdbchdfs job definition cannot be set for the master step if the job has a partition definition.  The partitionResultsTimeout is set for the individual partition steps only. The master steps fails after the default timeout.
R2193. The jdbchdfs jobs that are partitioned are running in sequence rather than in parallel. Our expectation with partition jobs is that they run in parallel.  Job configuration is:  jdbchdfs --driverClassName='oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver' --url='jdbc:oracle:thin:@=**********' --username='=**********' --password=********** --validationQuery='SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP FROM DUAL' --tableName='HZ_ORGANIZATION_PROFILES' --columns='ORGANIZATION_PROFILE_ID, ..., VERSION_NUMBER' --partitions=10 --partitionColumn='ORGANIZATION_PROFILE_ID' --directory='/ingest/source/oracle11i/ar/hz_organization_profiles' --fileName=hz_organization_profiles --fileExtension=csv --delimiter=| --commitInterval=10000 --rollover=262144000 --dateFormat=yyyy-mmm-dd --partitionResultsTimeout=1800000 --testOnBorrow=false 
R2194. Deployed component s are not deployed to the containers that failed and restarted.   We have 3 containers and 3 jobs where all jobs are deployed evenly, one job per container. However, when two of the containers fail and come back up, we end up with 3 jobs on 1 container.  See attached document for detail.  
R2195. The Batch Jobs Deployment screen  ('http://*****************:9393/admin-ui/#/jobs/deployments') UI screen is only showing 10 items without pagination and prohibiting users from launching their deployed jobs from the UI.  The jobs can only be launched via the RESTApi call  In release 1.0.3 the deployment page has not pagination but grows beyond 10 entries.
R2196. Similar to Sqoop where we move data from RDBMS to HDFS we should look at integrating with Camus to load data from Kafka to HDFS.
R2197. If automatic binding of dead letter is enabled for rabbit mq and taps are deployed, anytime the tap is undeployed, the dead letter for that tap still remains.  The tap uses a unique name and the queue for that is automatically deleted, but the dead letter queue for it is not.  This problem becomes worse when containers are running in yarn and may not live for long periods of time.  Many dead letter queues for taps can become overwhelming.
R2198. As a user, I'd like to use a _jdbchdfs_ batch job as a passthrough (without chunk processing) so that I don't have to incur the batch read/write overhead.
R2199. It should be possible to configure a (short) description for a module that is display above the module options  via {{module info --name ....}}.  The description could contain a few lines describing the core functionality and potentially hyperlinks  to additional information for a module.  This information should be exposed via the REST interface as well.  Currently only the module options are printed.
R2200. The GemFire client for SpringXD is throwing java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError for the class com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/client/internal/PingOp after a Stream sinking to gemfire-json-server is destroyed.    Issue starts after destroying a stream, which makes me think we might be unloading the jar files from the classpath while still keeping a connection to the gemfire server.    Steps to reproduce:    1) Create a region in Gemfire to test    e.g.: gfsh>create region --name=Stocks --type=REPLICATE  Member  | Status  ------- | -------------------------------------  server1 | Region "/Stocks" created on "server1"      2) Create a simple stream in Spring XD that writes to that region in gemfire-json-server. Deploy it for single node and let it run for a few seconds.      e.g.:    XD$ stream create streamx --definition "trigger --fixedDelay=3 | http-client --url='''https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select * from yahoo.finance.quote where symbol in (\"MSFT\")&format=json&env=store://datatables.org/alltableswithkeys''' --httpMethod=GET | splitter --expression=#jsonPath(payload,'$.query.results.quote') | gemfire-json-server --useLocator=true --host=localhost --port=10334 --regionName=Stocks --keyExpression=payload.getField('Symbol')" --deploy      3)  Destroy the stream    e.g.:  XD$  stream destroy streamx    3)  Wait a few seconds and check the xd-singlenode output.. you'll see the exception as following:    [error 2015/03/13 11:04:52.437 PDT  <poolTimer-client-pool-14> tid=0x15a] Unexpected error in pool task <com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.internal.LiveServerPinger$PingTask@635c9341>  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/client/internal/PingOp    com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.internal.LiveServerPinger$PingTask.run2(LiveServerPinger.java:83)    com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.client.internal.PoolImpl$PoolTask.run(PoolImpl.java:1197)    java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)    java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runAndReset(FutureTask.java:308)    com.gemstone.gemfire.internal.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorWithKeepAlive$DelegatingScheduledFuture.run(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorWithKeepAlive.java:252)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)    java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)    java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
R2201. ./gradlew install fails for spring-xd-extension-batch and spring-xd-extension-reactor. The first case is a simple update to gradle/build-extensions.gradle. The 2nd causes several compilation errors that are not trivial for a Reactor noob.  
R2202. Please see "Deployment" link on http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-xd/1.1.0.RELEASE/reference/html/#_module_deployment page.     !broken-link-deployment.png!    The link is broken and redirects to http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-xd/1.1.0.RELEASE/reference/html/Deployment which is a 404.
R2203. Composing "transform" and "gemfire-json-server" modules leads to FileNotFoundException during stream deployment when:  - xd-admin and xd-container are started as system services (after installing from

xd-singlenode script is started from within "$XD_HOME/bin directory {code}  $ cd "$XD_HOME/bin"  $ ./xd-singelonde  {code}    Then using the XD Shell:    {code}  $ xd-shell  > module compose --name

R2204. As a developer, I'd like to decouple execution context from job launch lifecycle so that we can avoid CL and serialization errors.     This fix needs to be formally applied in Spring Batch itself. XD will upgrade to Batch release in order to inherit this functionality; hence, the current workaround with XD-2486 needs reafctored. 
R2205. The current jdbchdfs job does not take advantage of all the features available to write into HDFS provided by Spring Hadoop's DataStoreWriter implementations, such as partitioning.  Update the jdbchdfs job to use <int-hadoop:store-writer/> (similar to the HDFS Sink) inside a new ItemWriter implementation  
R2206. Currently when modules are composed to a single application context, properties are not inherited.    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/wiki/Modules#placeholders-available-to-all-modules    
R2207. Scenario running a "rabbit | hdfs" stream and killing the xd-container while stream is running.  Looks like the messages get's acked before the data is flushed to hdfs.  This results in some data lost due to data either in tmp file or cached in the dfs client.  Reference: VESC-387
R2208. This apparently is not tested or used internally, but I expect it to fail having tried a similar approach to derive the class of a generic type in a different situation. This method does not always work due to type erasure http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3403909/get-generic-type-of-class-at-runtime.  We need to verify if this is working, if not fix it. The API may require it, so possibly UnsupportedOperationException...     {code}  /**     * Infers the type from this class's generic type argument     * @param kryo     * @param input     * @return   */  protected T doDeserialize(Kryo kryo, Input input) {  	Class<T> type = (Class<T>) (  				(ParameterizedType) this.getClass().getGenericSuperclass()).getActualTypeArguments()[0];  		return doDeserialize(kryo, input, type);  }  {code}
R2209. Not going to integrate with Reactor for stream processing.
R2210. A placeholder to investigate what can be done with Spring configuration in Module Options Metadata classes to simplify/enhance property configuration.  With @Configuration modules, these may now be beans in the module context. 
R2211. There are test failures running XD distributed tests.     It looks like all the test failures are related to NPE on DeploymentProperties format:    java.lang.NullPointerException    org.springframework.xd.rest.domain.support.DeploymentPropertiesFormat.formatDeploymentProperties(DeploymentPropertiesFormat.java:72)    org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.JobTemplate.deploy(JobTemplate.java:71)    org.springframework.xd.distributed.test.JobStateTests.testJobStateTransition(JobStateTests.java:83)
R2212. Thanks to Gary I found this little gem of documentation to be able to use xpath expression in XD. Only hiccup is that I had to also add the spring-xml.jar to the classpath (otherwise it is missing XPathException class).     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29110757/spring-xd-work-with-xml-payload
R2213. This keeps coming up as an issue that prevents us from publishing to maven central.
R2214. This is an improvement ticket to address refactoring of XD dirt classes especially XD admin(zk, deployment related) and container.
R2215. As a developer, I'd like to create a custom job module using Java Config so that I don't have to deal with XML configurations. While deploying/launching the following job, I get the error attached below.    {code:xml}  job create --name CDK_Global --definition "customBatchJob" --deploy  module upload --type job --name customBatchJob --file /Users/mminella/Documents/IntelliJWorkspace/CustomBatchModule/build/libs/CustomBatchModule-1.1.0.RELEASE.jar  job launch --name CDK_Global  {code}    *Error:*  I'm getting an exception that the job doesn't exist asking if it's deployed
R2216. Following the recent move of the doco to the main repo, it makes sense to have the doc generation be part of the "main" build, at an early stage, as an incentive for developers to push doc changes as soon as they change the code.    
R2217. As a developer, I'd like to continue XD-on-Lattice/Diego PoC, and will be focused on the design of a pluggable SPI, so it is more generally applicable than Lattice, with the Receptor API being just one implementation option. 
R2218.

R2219. As a developer, I'd like to update all the module docs to also include _shortDescription_ so that it's available for users to learn more about the module.
R2220. As a developer, I'd like to host/read Python script (file) from HDFS, so I can use the shell processor in XD (on CF) to delegate data science functionality to Py runtime and receive the feedback back in XD.
R2221. As a developer, I'd like to rebalance partitions as we scale the containers, so I don't have to bring down the running stream/job to reestablish dynamic partitions.
R2222. When the job module is configured using java config, there seems to be some issue with the way out of the box job event listeners are created.    Please see the discussion here:    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1506
R2223. Currently, the Kafka source uses a StringDecoder by default - which is an invalid assumption if the payload is not the result of String conversion.     
R2224. As a Spring XD user, I want to have the ability to customize the encoders and decoders used by the Kafka source, sink and bus, so that I can customize data formats and choose the most appropriate strategy
R2225. As a user, I'd like to have the OOTB _gpfdist_ sink module, so I can use this module to do ultra fast data movement from various sources into GPDB/HAWQ.
R2226. As a developer, I'd like to setup UI infrastructure, so I can integrate admin_ui and Flo.
R2227. See conversation at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1509  Several source modules leverage a poller, with `fixedDelay` being a common name for one of the options.  There is actually PeriodicTriggerMixin available, which should be applied to all modules, to make sure configuration is harmonized.  See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1384/files  At the time of writing: {noformat} grep -r '<poller' . --include='*.xml' | grep -v build ./modules/source/file/config/file.xml:		<poller fixed-delay="${fixedDelay}" time-unit="SECONDS"/> ./modules/source/jdbc/config/jdbc.xml:		<poller fixed-delay="${fixedDelay}" time-unit="SECONDS"> ./modules/source/mail/config/mail.xml:			<poller fixed-delay="${fixedDelay}" time-unit="SECONDS"> ./modules/source/sftp/config/sftp.xml:		<poller fixed-delay="${fixedDelay}" time-unit="SECONDS" /> ./modules/source/time/config/time.xml:		<poller trigger="fixedDelayTrigger" /> {noformat} 
R2228. In SqoopRunner we manually set rm address, fs address and yarn classpath. YarnConfiguration.RM_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS is also needed for appmaster to function properly.  Current workaround is to use config values which gets imported automatically: {code} spring:     hadoop:         config:             yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.address: <host>:8030 {code} 
R2229. Provide design for how we are going to run XD and Kafka on Rackspace.  This includes the base design for the Kafka Perf tests environment.  This will be used to provide a budget for the cloud resources  for the performance environment.  
R2230. As a developer, I'd like to create a end-to-end Kafka use-case, so I can study, demonstrate, and verify kafka + xd play that's built for scale and performance.
R2231. As a developer, I'd like to use an efficient approach to read files, so I don't have to read line-by-line and keep it in-memory in order to consume/write the file content.     Would the _tasklet_ approach be better as opposed to transmitting data via message bus (as streams)? 
R2232. Modules are loaded in the container as such (in DeploymentListener):  {code} try { 	module = (ModuleType.job.toString().equals(moduleType)) ? 			deployJobModule(client, unitName, moduleLabel, properties) : 			deployStreamModule(client, unitName, moduleType, moduleLabel, properties); 	if (module == null) { 		status = new ModuleDeploymentStatus(container, moduleSequence, key, ModuleDeploymentStatus.State.failed, 				"Module deployment returned null"); 	} 	else { 		status = new ModuleDeploymentStatus(container, moduleSequence, key, 				ModuleDeploymentStatus.State.deployed, null); 	} } catch (Exception e) { 	status = new ModuleDeploymentStatus(container, moduleSequence, key, ModuleDeploymentStatus.State.failed, 			ZooKeeperUtils.getStackTrace(e)); 	logger.error("Exception deploying module", e); }  try { 	writeModuleMetadata(client, module, path); 	client.setData().forPath(status.buildPath(), ZooKeeperUtils.mapToBytes(status.toMap())); } catch (KeeperException.NoNodeException e) { 	logger.warn("During deployment of module {} of type {} for {} with sequence number {}," + 					"an undeployment request was detected; this module will be undeployed.", moduleLabel, 			moduleType, unitName, moduleSequence); 	if (logger.isTraceEnabled()) { 		logger.trace("Path " + path + " was removed", e); 	} } {code}  The problem is if an {{Error}} is thrown, such as {{NoClassDefFoundError}} or {{NoSuchMethodError}}. We need to make a best effort when writing the deployment status to prevent the supervisor from timing out waiting for a status.
R2233. As a developer, I'd like to create a _gpload_ tasklet, so I can ingest data from various sources into GPDB in an efficient manner.
R2234. The ZK distributed queue consumer is initialized even before the module, stream, job deployment requests path cache are started.

R2238. As a developer, I'd like to remove Hadoop dependencies from root classpath, so we don't have to incur the penalty of classloading unnecessary libraries at the startup time.    The goal is to at least try and decouple for situations when HDFS is not used for module registry. 
R2239. As a developer, I'd like to add support for dynamic classpath for modules, so we can have the flexibility to load the right dependencies either based on module options (0) or via other properties such as including the dependencies from a specific location (1).

R2249. Initial support for partitioned batch jobs (initially tested with a local bus) had an {{ExecutorChannel}} in the job context to enable multiple partitions to run. Otherwise, with a local bus, only one partition would run at a time.    When further work was done to support other buses, this was removed and the bus was used to control partition concurrency.    The {{LocalMessageBus}} was changed to use an unbounded task executor; this was wrong because now all partitions ran at once.    Further changes to the local bus changed the task executor to be pooled, but with default properties that mean only one thread is used.    Further, the pool configuration is bus-wide so you can't use that configuration to select the concurrency for an individual job.    The bottom line is that the local bus is not suitable for partitioned batch jobs; it was not anticipated that it would be used for this scenario. With 1.0.x too many partitions run (all); with 1.1.x only one thread runs (by default).    In the local bus, we need to use a configurable, dedicated, bounded task executor for each batch job. 
R2250. As a user, I logged in with ROLE_CREATE and I get an error while trying job creation from admin_ui. I can create job from the shell successfully. Trying the same workflow with ROLE_ADMIN results with the same error as well. I don't see anything in the admin/container logs about the error itself. 
R2251. If not properly logged-in you will see errors like this one: "Command 'module list' was found but is not currently available (type 'help' then ENTER to learn about this command)"  It should possible state something like: "You don't have the credentials to execute the respective command. Please ensure that you are properly authenticated and have the necessary security roles."
R2252. Currently the shell does not automatically detect whether authentication for the targeted admin server is necessary.   Upon start, or change of the admin server URL, the shell should check the requirements, and if necessary prompt the user to provide credentials.   There is also a REST endpoint that could be used for that:  {code} http://localhost:9393/security/info {code}  See also XD-2870 for reference.

R2258. As a pre-requisite for XD-2835 and a continuation of XD-2671, split apart the concepts of repository and deployment. This will affect the {{ResourceDeployer}} interface and the classes that implement it.
R2259. When creating a new module with a dependeny which has a newer version than the one Spring-xd uses (in my example I use Jedis 2.6.1 and Spring-xd uses Jedis 2.5.2) the packaging ignores the dependency.  Using the solution of spring-boot-maven-plugin, doesn't help because it will only include what you explicitly add to the include section (transitive dependencies are not included)
R2260. As a developer, I'd like to add support for explicit partition count configuration, so I can use this option to cleverly route the payload to the intended consumer (module).
R2261. As a developer, I'd like to add support for dynamic partition subscription for the Kafka source module, so I can consume the payload from dynamic partitions.
R2262. As a developer, I need to investigate the differences in dependency versions, so when I create/deploy custom modules in XD, I don't run into CP/CL issues.
R2263. As a user, I'd like to have an option to have the hdfs sink use "Syncable" writes to provide better resiliency in the case of sink/container failures. I'm willing to accept the performance penalty if I choose this option. 
R2264. As a user, I'd like to have an option to have the hdfs sink not use a temporary inUseSuffix like .tmp. Instead we should write using the filename specified directly. This could be useful if we use "Syncable" writes and the sink fails while the file is open. Without this new option the user would have to explicitly rename the file.
R2265. The current build ships everything that is found in the modules directory, including build artifacts such as build/ or IDEA *.iml files.    Restrict the build to only include config/, lib/ at the moment.
R2266. I am using the XD shell to create a stream that pulls from an Oauth source to HDFS as my sink. Does Spring XD have some standard approach to this? Here were some thoughts   1.Use http source with mappedRequestHeaders.(Not sure how to pass the OAuth here) 2.Create HttpOutboundGateway that will execute a GET request. 3.Code a new twitter like source and build the source code. 
R2267. Similar to the DetailedModuleDefinitionResource that is returned when querying a single module, but would be returned when listing (provided a ?full flag has been turned on)
R2268. As a user, I'd like to also have the capability to upload the custom module through maven/gradle targets, so I can automate the installation of custom module fragments.
R2269. As a user, I'd like to have the option to version the custom modules, so I can evolve the custom module fragments in increments and be able to roll-out upgrades seamlessly.
R2270. As a user, I'd like to have the option to read the file line by line, so I get the optional OOTB optimum file reading experience.
R2271. When uploading a new version of a module the admin container if there is already an existing module, the behavior should be to delete the existing contents of the module directory and replace it with that of the new upload jar.    This would be an optional parameter.
R2272. As a developer, I'd like to certify Spring XD against PHD 3.0, so I can synchronize with the latest ODP based bits. 
R2273. Characters line \t, \n, etc. should be either escaped, or rendered as human readable variants in module info (eg <newline>)
R2274. Add early validation for cron expression Ease validation of maxOne/atLeastOne mutually exclusive options
R2275. While creation sqoop and providing the password for the sqoop jobs the guid does not mask the password with a '*********'.
R2276. As a user, I'd like to have the configuration option to use an alternative DLQ, so I can publish the message this time with additional headers, including one that contains the exception (and stack trace).  
R2277. As a user, I'd like to have the OOTB module to consume database changes as event streams, so I can incrementally synchronize with real-time DB updates with various destinations such as Brokers, Hadoop, DB, etc. 
R2278. There doesn't seem to be a way to configure the XD shell for accessing a kerberos secured cluster.  Tried this: >hadoop config props set --property hadoop.security.authorization=true >hadoop config props set --property hadoop.http.authentication.type=kerberos  still getting: >hadoop fs ls /xd Hadoop configuration changed, re-initializing shell... ls: SIMPLE authentication is not enabled.  Available:[TOKEN, KERBEROS] 
R2279. As a developer, I would like to connect to the broker that hosts the Rabbit queue, so I can connect to a Rabbit cluster that's setup for HA/FT. Perhaps consider having this feature natively supported in spring amqp itself.
R2280. As a developer, I'd like to synchronize with the latest Gemfire version (8.1?), so I can leverage the latest Gemfire features and as well support updated BDS stack.    This effort in XD depends on Spring Data Gosling GA release, which in turn depends on Gemfire 8.1 release timelines. 
R2281. As a developer, I'd like to deploy a stream in the same container, so all modules are colocated within the container. Perhaps also consider building leader election within modules in order to automatically failover the application (stream) from one container to another. 
R2282. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to SI milestone/GA release, so I can synchronize with JMX improvements.      This is dependent on SI Milestone and GA release timelines.
R2283. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to SI Kafka release, so I can synchronize with latest improvements and bug fixes.  
R2284. As a user, I'd like to upgrade to Spring Boot 1.2.3 release, do I can leverage the latest improvements and bug fixes.    We should also sync-up the following dependency updates to [synchronize with Boot|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-dependencies/pom.xml]:  {code}  <logback.version>1.1.3</logback.version>  <jackson.version>2.5.1</jackson.version>  <gemfire.version>8.0.0</gemfire.version>  <h2.version>1.4.185</h2.version>  <javax-mail.version>1.5.3</javax-mail.version>  <undertow.version>1.2.3.Final</undertow.version>  <joda-time.version>2.7</joda-time.version>  <nekohtml.version>1.9.21</nekohtml.version>  <activemq.version>5.11.1</activemq.version>  <antlr2.version>2.7.7</antlr2.version>  <commons-dbcp2.version>2.0.1</commons-dbcp2.version>  <tomcat.version>8.0.21</tomcat.version>  <aspectj.version>1.8.5</aspectj.version>  <groovy.version>2.4.3</groovy.version>  <crashub.version>1.3.1</crashub.version>  <jetty.version>9.2.9.v20150224</jetty.version>  <elasticsearch.version>1.4.4</elasticsearch.version>  <flyway.version>3.2.1</flyway.version>  <freemarker.version>2.3.22</freemarker.version>  <jdom2.version>2.0.6</jdom2.version>  <liquibase.version>3.3.2</liquibase.version>  <mockito.version>1.10.19</mockito.version>  mongodb.version>2.13.0</mongodb.version>  <slf4j.version>1.7.11</slf4j.version>  <spring-cloud-connectors.version>1.1.1.RELEASE</spring-cloud-connectors.version>  <spring-security.version>4.0.1.RELEASE</spring-security.version>  <jedis.version>2.6.2</jedis.version>  <spring-ws.version>2.2.1.RELEASE</spring-ws.version>  {code}
R2285. As a developer, I'd like to complete the remaining work with DEBS challenge, so I can submit by the deadline.
R2286. As a developer, I'd like to add a new CI build to include _install_ target, so I can verify the target expectations, as it is often time consuming to verify it in the development environment.
R2287. As a developer, I'd like to have the XD + Kafka POC published in samples repo, so I can include it as reference architecture for the XD blog.
R2288. After the Introduction to XD-2861 the acquisition of JobResources takes more time.  We have to introduce a pause to wait for getJobDefinitionResource to be populated. 
R2289. As a developer, I'd like to revisit performance benchmarks with new improvements, so I can verify the optimizations around _jdbchdfs_.
R2290. As a developer, I'd like to bench test cases around {{TupleBuilder}}, so I can identify the bottlenecks and tune for performance optimizations. 
R2291. As a developer, I'd like to have a simplified UX around parameters for GPDB, so I don't have to escape each parameter. The scope is also to test the Sqoop job with SQLServer and GPDB to identify the UX differences.
R2292. As a developer, I'd like to migrate module deployment from the "repository" abstraction (used for stream/job definitions), so I can create it as a pluggable runtime SPI.
R2293. As a developer, I'd like to build isolated Boot-based {{ModuleRunner}} for use in container-managed environments, so I can run XD without the hard requirement for running _xd-containers_.
R2294. As a developer, I'd like to create a [java client|https://github.com/markfisher/receptor-client] for Receptor, so I can interact with Diego runtime via Receptor API calls from XD. 
R2295. As a developer, I'd like to refactor stream/job definition repository, so I can decouple from module deployment concerns.
R2296. As a developer, I'd like to define pluggable runtime SPI, so I have the option to choose the implementation based on deployment targets such as CF, on-prem, Mesos etc.
R2297. As a developer, I'd like to create persistent repository for streams, so I could leverage the persisted metadata and reestablish the streaming pipe under failure conditions.
R2298. Currently dynamic router sink has to return a valid queue name. This is problematic when the message should be discarded as part of the routing process. In this case one have to define a stream with {{filter | router}} steps where part of the SpEL is duplicated between {{filter}} and {{router}} modules.    Instead the dynamic router should allow to return null to discard the message and stop further processing. Spring Integration is already providing {{resolution-required}} attribute on {{<router/>}}. 
R2299. As a developer, I'd like to add documentation on escape quotes, so when someone using Sqoop job can double escape {{\\\\N}} instead of sending quotes {{'\N'}} to successfully submit the job.
R2300. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to create streaming pipelines, so I can take advantage of latest specs from both XD and Spark/Spark Streaming.
R2301. If a spark streaming module is setup to connect to a pub/sub channel (a topic or a tap channel), then it doesn't bind to it.    For instance, if I have a stream "ingest" with a definition "http | log" and want to create another stream as,  "tap:stream:ingest > spark-processor | count" then this stream doesn't work.
R2302. We need to support adding a tap stream that connects to spark streaming processor module's output channel.
R2303. This creates a dependency cycle that eclipse can't handle (doesn't discern between scope like IDEA does).  I believe we can get rid of dummy() in tests that are in spring-xd-module  
R2304.

R2305. As a developer, I'd like to document how to nest batch jobs and workflows in XD, so it will be easy for end-users to use it as reference. 
R2306. As a developer, I'd like to configure HADOOP_USER_NAME environment variable to implement and run-as-user for kerberos secured clusters. This would need some additional work in SHDP.
R2307. If the admin UI is secured, the login page is displayed without any styles.
R2308. When copying those xml files to spring xd conf, spring xd doesn't pickup those classpath correctly. those classpath contains ${stack.name}, ${stack.version}. Those were processed correctly inside phd3/hdp, but not in spring xd. 
R2309. As a user, I'd like to parameterize all Import Options, so I can eliminate the need for {{—args}} option since it gets confusing.
R2310. As a user, I'd like to parameterize CodeGen Options, so I can generate code on the fly as needed.     
R2311. As a user, I'd like to parameterize Merge Options, so I can incrementally consume the delta with the help of megastore.   
R2312. As a user, I'd like to have an option to specify _timeout_, so I can expect the job to not run forever if it is in hung state.

R2314. As a user, I need to use XD Sqoop module to support the merge command.  Currently, the SqoopRunner createFinalArguments method forces the requirement for connect, username and password options which are not valid for the merge option. A check of the module type to not force these options being assigned to sqoop arg list would be preferred
R2315. In line with the checks we do for options documentation.  Currently made more complicated than it should because of rogue folders (such as scripts/ and analytics-pmml/ in the registry)
R2316. Start XD distributed XD with specified management port and  xd:    messageRateMonitoring:      enabled: true  in servers.yml  to gather stats.    Create stream {{file | log}}, deploy it, navigate to Containers tab in Admin UI. Rates are shown correctly.  Create stream {{MYFILE: file | log}}, deploy it, navigate to Containers tab in Admin UI - none of the message rates are shown. Open browser dev tools console and note 500 error response.    spring-xd-dirt -> ContainersController lines 109-112 creates request to get message rates for modules.

property.    The module id is somewhat problematic in the request: {{xd.str4:module=log.*}} index is {{\*}} but should be index within the stream, also node type (source/sink/processor) is missing. Therefore, stream {{mail | mail}} is suffering from the same problem.    Would be nice to have some sort of a bulk request to query more than one module for input/output message rates, such that I could get all message rates for modules in the stream.
R2317. It would be nice to have a simple ftp source. I have to do it for one of my projects. Same as XD-2139 but for source modules.
R2318. As a users I would to be able to execute SQL Statement/Script via a Processor or Job statement.
R2319. The twittersearch source module picks up the same tweet in successive iterations of the REST request. The reason for this is that the since_id value being set at the end of each iteration is the last item in the list of tweets, but not the latest value of tweet id.  Steps to reproduce:  Created a stream using below definition  stream create --name twittersearchspring --definition "twittersearch --consumerKey=<key> --consumerSecret=<secret> --query='spring' | tweet-transformer | file" --deploy  tweet-transformer referred here is used from the spring-xd-samples repo and is logging the tweet ID being transformed https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-samples/tree/master/tweet-transformer-processor  Below is the log  __________ 2015-04-14 15:47:22,154 1.1.0.RELEASE  INFO DeploymentSupervisor-0 server.StreamDeploymentListener -

R2320. As a user I want to be able to provide my own RowMapper<Tuple> implementation to enrich the jdbc data.   My use case requires me to add timestamp field and a delete flag field to records before they get written to HDFS. To do it, I have to implement a ItemReaderFactory and perhaps extend NameColumnJdbcItemReader. This is to override the afterPropertySet method to change the default implementation.  Otherwise I have to write my own Processor that can add these fields to Tuples, and since tuples are immutable I would have to recreate the tuples with additional fields in the processor. For large load this could be big overhead.  I would love to know any other technique to implement such a use case.
R2321. As a user, I'd like to have the ability to use expressions, so I can dynamically name directories/files based on the timestamp or other intermediate data point.
R2322. It is possible to specify the location of custom modules via the environment variable {{XD_CUSTOMMODULE_HOME}} which is provided by Spring Boot property key derivation mechanism (in this case derived from {{xd.customModule.home}}).  This allows a user to specify a custom modules location that survives a complete wipe of spring-xd installations.
R2323. When using the rest interface to create a Job with an empty description, used to generate the following exception, "Definition can not be empty".   Now generates "XD112E:(pos 0): Unexpectedly ran out of input^".   The correct error should be, "definition cannot be blank or null"    
R2324. See https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/messages/24095632  However, it was set to ERROR last year to "reduce log noise".  I would prefer to elevate to at least WARN in XD and address the "noise" issue in Spring AMQP.
R2325. As the decision for directBinding may become more complicated (see eg XD-2946), move the *decision* part out of the bus, leaving only the *application* there (leveraging a pre-computed property, such as directBind=true).  The computation of that property is to be moved at the deployer level
R2326. As as user I want to be able to escape delimiter character. Currently I cannot use this job oob to create CSVs that are usable in Hive/HAWQ because of unescaped delimiters.  
R2327. Code that is in there could be moved to the SparkStreamingModule.    Then, as part of a later refactoring, that plugin should be made part of the module (and loaded by the module classloader)
R2328. As a developer, I'd like to refactor the programmatic means by which the MessageBus transforms the Message so throughput performance can be optimized.  
R2329. As a developer, I'd like revisit the design to determine the necessity for _ID_ and _TimeStamp_ attributes in {{Tuple}}, so I can refactor in order to improve performance throughput.
R2330. As a developer, I'd like to document the Kryo optimization guidelines, so the end-users can refer to it while tuning to improve performance.
R2331. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to Kafka 0.8.2, so I can leverage the latest features in order to test the performance characteristics.
R2332. As a developer, I'd like to create a Tuple _load-generator_, so I can use it to measure {{Tuple}} based payload performance. 
R2333. As a developer, I'd like to create a new _load-generator_, so I can use it to measure highly optimized (kryo serialized) payload to measure the performance differences. 
R2334. As a developer, I'd like to rerun _baseline_, _Tuple_, and _Serialized_ payloads, so I can compare the differences in performance between 0.8.1 and 0.8.2 Kafka releases.     Note:  1.1.1 > Benched against 0.8.1   1.2 > Benched against 0.8.2     
R2335. As a developer, I'd like to document performance benchmark results along with the infrastructure specifics, so I can publish the blog for customers/users to use it as a reference while setting up Spring XD cluster.
R2336. As a developer, I'd like to study the state management requirements, so I can brainstorm and identify the design to natively add _stateful_ stream processing support in XD. 
R2337. As a developer, I'd like to integrate with Spring Data repository that's backed by Kafka _changelog_, so I can leverage the benefits of local data affinity (off-heap) in order to run stateful stream processing logic. 
R2338. As a developer, I'd like to add support to _flush_ offsets intelligently, so I can reliably process streams based on successful message acknowledgements from the module-producer. 
R2339. As a developer, I'd like to add support to _flush_ state intelligently, so I can reliably process streams based on successful message acknowledgements from the module-producer. 
R2340. As a developer, I'd like to have the option of CoAP source module, so I can consume data using bandwidth efficient protocol that fits in constrained embedded environment.
R2341. In XD today we use  commons-logging or slf4j  APIs bound to log4j at runtime (configured with log4j.properties).      Boot uses slf4j APIs backed by logback. This causes some build incompatibilities building a component that depends on spring-xd-dirt and spring-boot, requiring specific dependency exclusions.  In order to simplify building and troubleshooting log dependencies, XD should standardize on   slf4j APIs (replace any commons-logging Loggers with Slf4j). This is internal only, and would not impact users who are used to seeing log4j.properties. An additional step is to replace log4j with logback. This change would be visible to end users but will provide us greater affinity with boot and improve the developer experience. If we make this change it should go into 1.2 GA.    
R2342. As a user, I'd like to refer to the documentation to configure the properties file, so I can use it as recommended to represent the deployment manifest.
R2343. Cannot import Spring XD into STS without compilation errors in class:    *org.springframework.xd.dirt.rest.ModulesController#list*    Error is in:    {code}  return assembler.toResource(page, detailed ? detailedAssembler: simpleAssembler);  {code}    {code}  The method toResource(Page<ModuleDefinition>, Link) in the type PagedResourcesAssembler<ModuleDefinition> is not applicable for the arguments (Page<ModuleDefinition>, (detailed ? detailedAssembler : simpleAssembler))  {code}    Seems to be an STS specific issue.
R2344. As a user, I'd like to run the sqoop jobs against secured hdfs cluster, so I can restrict access to only authorized users.

R2346. For some reason, the message bus is bound to incorrect transport (different from what is set as XD_TRANSPORT) at runtime.

R2347. Currently, each HTTP stream channel uses its own port, which is a limitation if we want to use large numbers of HTTP streams with fine granularity. It would be nice to (additionally) use URI paths to identify HTTP channels, allowing to re-use a single HTTP port for multiple channels in XD.  Example usage:  stream create --name s1 --definition "http --port=9495 --path=/foo  | log" --deploy  For a PoC implementation, see: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1538
R2348. When i create following stream i am able to route json messages. But if i send same message as an array its not working. Is it possible to do something about it?  stream create --name reference-data-import --definition "rabbit --outputType=text/plain | router --expression=#jsonPath(payload,'$.REJECTED').contains('true')?'queue:Rejected':'queue:Accepted'" --deploy  
R2349. As a user, I'd like to use the Java receptor client, so I can interact with Diego runtime using the Java receptor REST APIs.
R2350. As a user, I'd like to use Boot-based {{ModuleRunner}} for use in container-managed environments, so I can run XD without _xd-containers_.    Scope:  * Complete the remaining deployment properties work
R2351. i've created a source module for polling a twitter timeline using the spring integration twitter inbound adapter. I've placed my api keys in the modules.yml file and verified that they are picked up by the twitterstream and twitterseach modules that come with SpringXD. However, they are not picked up by my custom module. I viewed the source for both the stream and and the search and i feel my project is near identical in configuration. Am i missing something or are these properties somehow special for just the two twitter sources that come with SpringXD?  I'd like to get this working and commit it to the project.
R2352. see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29822845/custom-python-module-can-not-re-excute-when-raise-exception-in-module  
R2353. With message rates enabled and container management enabled, if you deploy a streaming module, the container page may be blank.  Because the streaming module builds the channels outside the spring context (spark receiver is ran in the spark cluster not in xd) there is no need to setup the input and/or output channels.  When these channels aren't defined the rest call from admin UI will fail because it will not find the message rates returned in the JSON from the JMX call.  {code} Advice - Caught exception while handling a request org.codehaus.jettison.json.JSONException: JSONObject["value"] not found.         at org.codehaus.jettison.json.JSONObject.get(JSONObject.java:360)         at org.codehaus.jettison.json.JSONObject.getJSONObject(JSONObject.java:454)         at org.springframework.xd.dirt.rest.ContainersController.getMessageRate(ContainersController.java:146)         at org.springframework.xd.dirt.rest.ContainersController.list(ContainersController.java:121) {code}  As a work around, I have included the input and output channels for a spark streaming processor which is not used anywhere.  This gives a bad side affect of looking like the module isn't processing with message rates of 0, but everything else is now shown.
R2354. XD-2837 added back the --hadoopDistro option for xd-admin scripts. However, if I try to use it I get an error message saying: "--hadoopDistro" is not a valid option  
R2355. As a follow up to XD-2877, experiment with the removal of the list of modules from BaseDefinition and reparse as needed.    Branch is here: https://github.com/pperalta/spring-xd/tree/deploy-refactor-2
R2356. the update to the JMX was introduced in XD-2941.   Also noticed that we should have been checking source and not sink .  This was also resolved.
R2357. SpringXD seems to think that a module exists if there is a module configuration present. There is also an issue of having to restart the node when theres been a problem with uploading/removing a module.  When using SpringXD in single node on windows, i uploaded a custom module and then added a folder and property file for it in the module configuration directory as specified in the documentation. When i went to delete the module using the command in the SpringXD admin console, it would say that it was successfull, but when then listing the modules, it would still be listed. If i tried to upload a new version of that same module, i would get an error stating that module already existed with the same name. I would check the custom modules directory and my jar would not be there. I would then have to manually delete the module configuration directory and restart SpringXD before being able to upload a new module, having to replace my module configuration each time.  Seems like there are three things wrong here: * should the presence of a module configuration alone inform SpringXD of a modules existence? * should one have to delete a module configuration before uploading a new version of the module? * when getting module deletion/upload errors, should one have to restart spring xd node to get it to allow the upload again?
R2358. As a user, I'd like to have the option of reliable HDFS writes (for stream pipelines), so I can get acknowledgement of actual HDFS _commits_ as opposed to just from the message bus.
R2359. As a developer, I’d like override the partition function within my source or processor module, so I can send the data to a specific partition.
R2360. As a user, I'd like to consume multiple topic-partitions, so I can have the option to consume from multiple data endpoints and still be able to serve the data via single queue.
R2361. As a Flo developer, I'd like to have a new DSL parser, so I can easily  detect incorrect module/option values when supplied from the Flo UI.    Example:  MyStream = mail | log  tap:stream:MyStream.bar > log    If parsed separately (which Flo UI does), the current parser endpoint will barf on the second stream because it doesn’t know about the first stream (MyStream). 
R2362. This tests should prove that Kafka can handle a module count greater than one with the proper concurrency settings.  load-generator should be used as the foundation for this test with the following settings:  module.load-generator.count=10,module.throughput.consumer.concurrency=10    An environment should be provisioned to support the containers, Zookeeper and Kafka.

R2364. As a developer, I want that the Spring XD partitioning process targets Kafka bus partitions directly, so that the design of my stream processing application is easier to understand and the order of messages is not altered    Current situation  - Spring XD partitioning logic that builds on top of Kafka partitioning;  - The number of Spring XD partitions is not explicitly configured (it's inferred from the number of consumer modules)  - If the concurrency of the consumer modules is 1, then Spring XD partitions are matched 1:1 with Kafka partitions;  -  If the concurrency of the consumer modules is n, then a Spring XD partition uses n Kafka partitions, and the message bus distributes messages across the Kafka partitions that correspond to the Spring XD partitions;  - this could be confusing to the end user, especially if they are used to the Kafka partitioning process;  - this can also lead to changes of ordering between messages, as messages within the same Spring XD partitions will be sent to different Kafka partitions (this only happens if the concurrency of the receiving module is higher than 1)    Improvement:  - *For the Kafka message bus* the number of Spring XD partitions does not need to be equal to the number of modules (must be higher or equal, though, so that consumers can be created), and should be configured explicitly - using the `partitionCount` property - (as an option, the module count * concurrency can be used as a default)   - as a result, in the case of Kafka there will always be a 1:1 match between Kafka partitions and Spring XD partitions, optionally processed by fewer modules than the partition count;
R2365. As a developer, I'd like to design and document the approach towards deploying stream in a single container, so I can have all modules within a stream colocated.

R2370. Currently, the module options provided for Spark streaming processor/sink modules use the same DefaultSparkStreamingModuleOptionsMetadata. Since we start adding new module options for processor/sink specific modules, it would be better if we expose specific ModuleOption classes so that would help the implementing developers.
R2371. As a user, I'd like to have the option to change the default Sqoop _metastore_, so I can implement a DB of my choice and not tied to default specifications.    Refer to this [thread|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24078668/how-to-change-sqoop-metastore] for more details. 
R2372. The call to /modules?detailed=true that was introduced for Flo proves to be a performance hog, most certainly because of all the metadata resolution that has to occur there (and no caching takes place)

R2374. Created a single definition Sqoop Job --create statement. When processed through Sqoop direct (see attach image for props in repos. jobname sqoop2)   Notice: job definition set db.require.password = false and has a propname called db.password that holds the value for password.   When same definition is created as a batch job via Spring-XD (see image jobname lookupd_job), the db.require.password prop is set to "TRUE" and the db.password is not even created as a row.  This causes a password prompt when trying to execute the job in Sqoop direct, that was created via a spring-XD batch job.   Note the job definition for Spring-XD job contains meta-connect with username and password defined as well as import jdbc: --connect username and password. When created via Sqoop (no Spring-XD) password is stored and job is able to execute with no prompt.  Please see attachment for repository job values. Highlighted in yellow is the discrepant property and value attribution. Please reach out if there are questions or need further details.  To automate Spring-XD batch job using Sqoop via Spring we can not be prompted for password.

R2380. I am using SpringXD to ingest tweets to a gemfire-json-server sink.  I am running into an issue where the json documents get defined as a pdx type twice.  See the reweet_count field below.  This causes problems later when using OQL to access this data.  Incompatible types.  What are the recommended ways to resolve this?  The field type should account for the largest possible value, which is unknown because it is twitter.  This would likely be a int or long.  I was asked to log this as a SXD JIRA issue, but I am not sure if the problem is in SXD or GemFire.

R2383. For example, how to specify the partition count for topics that are created by the message bus.
R2384. See:     https://sonar43.spring.io/drilldown/measures/7173?metric=package_tangle_index
R2385. We should update to use spring-data-hadoop 2.2.0.M1in order to use the fixes available for the HDFS writing there (syncable writes, timeout).    A few things to keep in mind:  - this updates Cloudera CDH to 5.3.3  - Kite version is now 1.0 - need to test the hdfs-dataset sink  
R2386. As a user, I'd like to refer to the documentation, so I can configure HDFS backed module registry (XD-2287) as recommended. 
R2387. As a user I would like the ability to undeploy or suspend a module without losing the deployment properties.  Currently when temporarily suspending a module an undeploy and redeploy is executed.  During the redeploy the deployment properties need to be added again.  Instead, it would be nice if the properties are persisted so they automatically included with the deployment.
R2388. Update the current docker images to 1.1.0 Release
R2389. This is a combination of two issues:  - the internal property `next.module.concurrency` is computed from `concurrency` when it should be computed from `consumer.concurrency`  - even if `next.module.concurrency` is set, the KafkaMessageBus rejects it, since it's not set in SUPPORTED_CONSUMER_PROPERTIES    As a result, the value used in partition calculation is always 1.    A workaround exists, by setting the `module.[moduleName].producer.minPartitionCount` property to the expected total value. 
R2390. As a user, I'd like to have a REST-API to get all the _counters_, _gauges_, and _rich-gauges_ in a single request, so I don't have to issue multiple request to fetch each one of the metrics by name/id for custom dashboards.    *Example:*  {code}  /metrics/counters/all (fetches all available counters)  /metrics/gauges/all (fetches all available gauges)  /metrics/rich-gauges/all (fetches all available rich-gauges)  {code}

R2392. As a spring developer, I can specify the default value for the module configs at the module config xml file and if no specific overriding options given the default value should get preferred.  Currently, I see that by design we want to rely on the default option values from the ModuleOption metadata. But, the cases where some module configurations can't have the default (say, customerKey for twitterstream module) and would be tempting to just try deploying after changing the twitterstream.xml with the default value expecting it to work.
R2393. 4.1.4 and 1.4.5 respectively.
R2394. The typo 'properites' should be replaced with the correct 'properties' in the following places:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=properites
R2395. We have installed the SpringXD 1.2 M1 release via the rpm and it seems that the sqoop-1.4.5-hadoop200.jar file are not part of the rpm. The sqoop jar file are not in the xd/lib directory.    This is causing a problem during customer module development if we include the sqoop-1.4.5-hadoop200 dependency as part of the pom file and forces us to redeploy the our jar as separate deployment.    Should we be referencing different dependencies or have or should the sqoop-1.4.5-hadoop200.jar be part of the rpm definition so it part of the xd/lib?    I have currently the following dependency in the pom file:    {code}  		<!-- Sqoop -->  		<dependency>  			<groupId>org.apache.sqoop</groupId>  			<artifactId>sqoop</artifactId>  			<version>1.4.5</version>  			<classifier>hadoop200</classifier>  		</dependency>  {code}    It would be great be great if the sqoop jar are part of rpm so we don't have to do any additional jar deployment.    Thanks, 
R2396. As part of p-spring-xd testing we create, deploy, exercise, undeploy and destroy a RabbitMQ to RabbitMQ stream every minute. Spring XD does not appear to be deleting the queues it creates internally for each stream. We have seen as many as ~9800 xdbus queues (via the RabbitMQ web ui) before RabbitMQ runs out of memory and blocks.
R2397. See discussion at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1537#issuecomment-99583179  This is likely a client error, so should be in the 4xx family. This requires customization of RestControllerAdvice

R2400. When the *stream* that holds the kafka source module is undeployed(but not destroyed yet), the underlying offset manager deletes the offsets associated with the steam.  When same stream is re-deployed, the offset manager reads the offsets from kafka broker (if initial offsets are *not* provided) for each partition the module is configured to listen.  If the initial offset values are provided for the stream, then I think the offset manager should delete the offsets from the XD offset topic only when the stream is *destroyed*. Since we want to re-use the offset topic data upon stream undeploy/re-deploy.  
R2401. See:  http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/#_introduction_26    There should be chapter/section title before this.

R2404. As a user, I'd like to use Boot-based {{ModuleRunner}} for use in container-managed environments, so I can run XD without _xd-containers_.    Scope:  * 
R2405. XD runtime (admin, container and singlenode) have MongoDB boot autoconfiguration enabled. This spins off MongoDB client and thereby the cleaner thread running on all these runtime.    The MongoDB based modules won't have any impact when we disable this autoconfiguration.   
R2406. As a user, I'd like to use the GF source along with native GF authentication enabled, so I can consume data from GF in a secured way. I'd like to refer to documentation on where the GF specific native and security properties needs configured.     See this [SC post|https://gopivotal-com.socialcast.com/messages/24377202] for more details.
R2407. As a user, I'd like to have an OOTB _jdbcgpfdist_ batch job, so I can read from JDBC and write to HAWQ/GPDB using _gpfdist_ protocol.   The scope is to reuse the existing gpfdist sink code and adapt it to fit the batch model (_gpfdist_ writer).   
R2408. As a developer, I'd like to separate mocks vs. real repository coupling from the test infrastructure, so it is easy to test against thin layer of dependencies.

R2411. Calling the API to delete queues uses a wildcard-like behaviour unexpectedly. If I request to delete:    {{test-1}}    I expect it to delete streams named with the pattern:    {{test-1.*}}    For example, it would delete:    {{test-1.0, test-1.1, etc}}    In fact I believe it wildcards before and after the period, e.g.:    {{test-1*.*}}    And hence would delete:    {{test-1.0, test-11.0, test-123.0, etc}}    That way of working is potentially helpful, but it's also dangerous because it removes the ability to know that you're only deleting the exact queue you want to in all cases.    For the record the commit (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/commit/2d5f3f706330a6ead8e91c9a7a23d4372715614d) implies that it should work in the more restricted way above, not the less restricted way.    (Note: I've marked this as an improvement because, absent documentation, I don't know what the correct functionality is and hence can't say this is a bug)
R2412. Identify and report hotspots while running the load-generator source and the throughput sink on :  # Singlenode -> In Memory Transport  # Singlenode -> Kafka Transport  # Admin/Container -> Kafka Transport
R2413. As a developer, I'd like to move the project reactor based [data processor module|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-modules/tree/master/spring-xd-reactor] from _spring-xd-module_ repo to the core, so I can natively use Reactor's Stream API to build processor modules. 
R2414. Spring XD has a gradle task available in the build called launch that starts a single node instance.  This is currently broken.  The command I was using for this command was:  {code}  $ ./gradlew clean build -x test -x javadoc launch  {code}
R2415. As a developer, I'd like to move the project reactor based [gpfdist|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-modules/tree/master/gpfdist] from spring-xd-module repo to the core, so I can natively use this sink to write to GPDB/HAWQ.  
R2416. When the admin leader is elected, the leader recalculates the deployed stream/job states. If for some reason the stream/job couldn't be loaded with ModuleConfigurationException, then the leader fails and subsequently all the deployment requests are being queued.  We need to discuss how to handle this situation. A possible fix could be something like this: https://github.com/ilayaperumalg/spring-xd/commit/fa6a48072197e8c350eaebe841191e4b6310f437  The issue is that, if the stream was already successfully deployed into a container, then the stream status would still be set to 'undeployed' by the admin leader during the recalculation.  Also, this issue is very minor as the ModuleConfigException would be thrown only if someone upgrades Admin that uses different module options config than the existing stream definitions.
R2417. Currently, the deployment message is being validated before pushed the ZK distributed queue for deployment. When the message is consumed, there is no validation done. Since, the consumer consumes the messages asynchronously, we need validation at both sides.
R2418. Failure example: https://build.spring.io/browse/XD-MASTER-2152
R2419. This is a source module for video ingestion: the modules captures video frames from a camera or from a video file. For camera, the frames are grabbed from the rtsp video stream. This module will generate message with the frame image (encoded with JPEG) as the payload.   
R2420. As a devops, I would prefer having my module registry located in centralized github repository. This would allow all the admins and containers in the cluster pointing to the same module registry. Any new module upload would be pushed to the same github repo which will make the cluster always be in sync on the Module Registry.

R2422. The story XD-2993 addresses the DSL parser to read the multi line stream definitions. We need to support adding multi line parser support for with the mixture of both stream/job definitions.  As a developer, I would setup job definition and have a stream definition that triggers the job in the same multi line content. 
R2423. When delegating to the conversion service, the ConversionFailedException does not have the context of which key caused the failure. Should probably wrap ConversionFailedException with IllegalArgumentException and add that context back in.
R2424. As a developer, I'd like to remove _ID_ and _TimeStamp_ attributes from the {{Tuple}} class, so I can improve performance characteristics by not having them go through _serde_; instead, we could leverage message headers to collect such information.   
R2425. Polled message sources return only one message per poll by default.    When polling, say, a file directory with many files, files will be emitted once per {{fixedDelay}}.    As a user I need to configure a limit for the number of messages that will be emitted per poll.
R2426. Looks to have been introduced by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1577  Deployment: single admin, 2 container deployment using +RabbitMQ+ as the transport.

R2427. Provide an option "--delete=true" on the File Source  If the file reading is not *ref*, an option *--delete=true* will remove the file once it was read.  
R2428. If you have a an option *--mode=textLine*, presently the enum MUST be named *textLine*.  I think it would improve the user-experience if we allowed users to pass in values such as:  * --mode=textLine * --mode=text_line * --mode=TEXT_LINE

R2430. As a user, I would like to specify the default output channel when the channel name resolution doesn't occur. In cases where I won't prefer to lose the data and like to investigate the messages from errorChannel or that sort.
R2431. Using the gemfire module as an example, there is currently at least two sources of leakage, retaining classes that are loaded by the module classloader (and hence everything from there).  One of them is because of JMX monitoring.  Another one I'm not sure about, but here is a screenshot
R2432. The POC for XD on Lattice uses the following interface for module deployment:    https://github.com/markfisher/xolpoc-admin/blob/master/src/main/java/xolpoc/spi/ModuleDeployer.java    {code}  public interface ModuleDeployer {    	void deploy(ModuleDescriptor descriptor);    	void undeploy(ModuleDescriptor descriptor);    	ModuleStatus getStatus(ModuleDescriptor descriptor);    }  {code}    This spike is to introduce this interface and the Lattice implementation in the XD admin. The goals are to:  * Demo a POC showing simple stream deployment with the existing shell/admin to Lattice  * Learn from the experience to help guide the re-architecture/splitting of stream/job repositories (especially in regard to {{AbstractDeployer}} and related classes).    Note that this work will not necessarily be merged into XD itself, although some of the concepts may be included in a future PR.
R2433. As a developer, I'd like to bench Rabbit on rackspace infrastructure, so I can have a sense on how it scales as we add more _xd-container_ nodes.
R2434. As a Flo developer, I'd like to add improvements to existing Flo parser endpoints, so I can streamline the error reporting strategy.
R2435. The {{LocalMessageBus}} uses the Integration Scheduler to run batch jobs  Launching batch jobs with the {{LocalMessageBus}} uses the Integration default {{taskScheduler}} which only has 10 threads by default.  Use the {{LocalMessageBus.executor}} instead to free up the scheduler threads.  However, we need to consider whether a separate configuration is needed to limit the number of batch jobs - it's possible the existing bus executor configuration is enough.
R2436. Backport stability improvements added as part of XD-2958 to the 1.1.x branch.
R2437. As part of XD-2958, we've changed the input type of the Kafka sink from String to byte[]. The main reason for the change was that it required an arbitrary and often unneeded (but expensive) conversion to String for the bus payloads.     Apply the same change to 1.1 branch.

R2439. As a developer, I'd like to default to HDFS as distributed remote location for custom module registry, so I can use xd-shell or the REST-API directly to upload the custom module bits. I would also like to remove custom-modules.zip artifact from YARN distribution.
R2440. We are running Spring XD 1.1.1 in our production environment and Zookeeper 3.4.5.  Zookeeper is running in failover mode and consists of three independent nodes set up on three separate VMs. From time to time we get "Connection to Zookeeper Suspended" event which causes one of the containers in the cluster to be removed from the SpringXD cluster. Modules being deployed on this removed node fail to be re-deployed to other containers in the cluster.    Affected versions:  - SpringXD 1.1.1  - Zookeeper 3.4.5 and 3.4.6    Cluster set up in PROD environment where error occurs:  - 4 Spring-XD dedicated servers  - 4 spring-xd containers (each running on designated server )  - 2 spring-xd admins ( each running alongside one spring-xd container)  - 3 Zookeeper nodes ( 3 designated servers on PAITO environment )    Cluster set up in TEST environment where error also occurred:  - 2 Spring-XD dedicated servers running one spring-xd container and one spring-xd admin each  - 3 Zookeeper nodes running on 3 dedicated servers (PAITO Test environment)    Cluster set up to reproduce error found in PROD environment:  - 1 spring-xd admin  - 3 spring xd-containers (each running on a designated VM )  - 3 zookeeper servers running on one VM    Steps to reproduce:    1)	Set up three node Zookeeper cluster. Attached is example zoo.cfg, we are using default configuration values. In this particular test case we run all Zookeeper nodes on a single VM as we were not testing network layer interruptions.  2)	Set up one Spring XD admin node. Please note that we have also observed this on two node Spring XD admin cluster.   3)	Set up three Spring XD container nodes. All of them belong to one group (SA) and two of them also belong to second group (HA1). This is configured in $XD_HOME/config/servers.yml however so far group configuration never influenced test outcome.  4)	Create and deploy a test stream using following XD Shell commands:  stream create --name test-zookeeper-failover --definition "syslog-udp --port=5140 | transform | file --dir='/opt/pivotal/spring-xd/xd/output'"  stream deploy --name test-zookeeper-failover --properties "module.syslog-udp.criteria=groups.contains('HA1'),module.syslog-udp.count=2,module.file.criteria=groups.contains('SA'),module.file.count=3,module.transform.criteria=groups.contains('SA')"  5)	Ensure that test stream works and handles traffic on UDP port 5140  6)	Shutdown one of the Zookeeper nodes by issuing a stop command.  7)	Two Spring XD containers were not affected and remained in Spring XD cluster.  8)	One Spring XD container was kicked out of Spring XD cluster and was no longer visible on Spring XD admin Web UI. Modules previously deployed to this container were not redeployed to other cluster members.  9)	On the failed Spring XD container we have observed CONNECTION_SUSPEND, CONNECTION_RECONECTED and CHILD_REMOVE Zookeeper events (attached is container-log.txt). Please note that Java process is still running and we see “ConnectionStateManager-0 server.ContainerRegistrar - Waiting for supervisor to clean up prior deployments�? messages.  10)	Spring XD admin failed with exception in DepartingContainerModuleRedeployer (attached is admin-log.txt).   11)	We have observed that departing container node in Zookeeper (/sa/deployments/modules/allocated/1d3fd4cc-5a70-47ed-b4f3-22deef1f4d4f/) had no children. We did this after few minutes so we are not sure at which point it was cleared.   12)	Restarting failed Spring XD container fixed the problem, modules were correctly redeployed.  Exception from point 10 is very similar to XD-1983 and this code was rewritten in XD-2004.  
R2441. Running Spring-XD singlenode with a kerberized hadoop cluster on CDH 5.3.2. with JDK 1.7 and JCE 1.7.  The kerberos ticket policies are:  * expiration: 24 hours  * renew: 7 days    I need to keep the Spring XD server running constantly because my flows are always waiting for incoming files to be ingested into the HDFS, but the kerberos session expires if there aren't jobs to run before the expiration date. The expiration policies can't be changed due internal company policies.    Is there a way which Spring XD can generate a new ticket instead of renew the current one when a job or stream start executing?    The Spring XD server has configured the hadoop.properties like:    # Use servers.yml to change URI for namenode  # You can add additional properties in this file  dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal=hdfs/_HOST@EDA.COMPANY.COM  yarn.resourcemanager.principal=yarn/_HOST@EDA.COMPANY.COM    yarn.application.classpath=/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop/*,/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop/lib/*,/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-hdfs/*,/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-hdfs/lib/*,/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-yarn/*,/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-yarn/lib/*,/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/*,/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/lib/*    hadoop.security.authorization=true  hadoop.security.authentication=kerberos    spring.hadoop.userKeytab=file:///export/home/user/user.keytab  spring.hadoop.userPrincipal=user@ERS.COMPANY.COM    #Connecting to Kerberized Hadoop (Spring XD doc configuration Appendix D)  spring.hadoop.security.authMethod=kerberos  spring.hadoop.security.userKeytab=/export/home/user/user.keytab  spring.hadoop.security.userPrincipal=user@ERS.COMPANY.COM  spring.hadoop.security.namenodePrincipal=hdfs/_HOST@EDA.COMPANY.COM  spring.hadoop.security.rmManagerPrincipal=yarn/_HOST@EDA.COMPANY.COM
R2442. When deploying streams to clustered Spring XD modules are deployed to all avilable Spring XD containers (assuming no additional deployment properties are specificed). Each container gets similar number of modules.   When Spring XD container departs from the cluster all departing modules will be migrated to remaining containers. After container rejoins the cluster the modules are not redeployed to it and the cluster looks unbalanced and the node is not used.  !unbalanced-cluster.png!

R2445. The null sink uses a bridge and in perf testing it seemed to introduce overhead.  Verify with throughput source and a hand-crafted 'no-op' MessageProcessor impl.
R2446. The {{testTapSparkProcessor}} has the test that checks the contents at the output of spark streaming word count processor. It turns out that the order in which these messages are processed are not always in order.
R2447. I created and launched a 'jdbchdfs' job. Due to network issues the job hung. Wasn't able to cancel it so I ended up destroying it.  After that I couldn't recreate the job since XD insisted hat there already was a job with that same name.   {code} xd:>job create jdbc1 --definition "jdbchdfs --columns=ID,FILE_PATH,FILE_NAME,YEAR,FILE_LENGHT,LAST_MODIFIED --tableName=SOMEFILES --checkColumn=ID --partitionColumn=ID --partitions=3 --partitionResultsTimeout=3000000 --rollover=128000000 --commitInterval=1000 --url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//redwood:1521/XE --driverClassName=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver --username=spring --password=spring --testOnBorrow=false" Successfully created job 'jdbc1' xd:>job deploy jdbc1 --properties "module.jdbchdfs.count=3" Deployed job 'jdbc1' xd:>job launch jdbc1 Successfully submitted launch request for job 'jdbc1'  (Here the job was hung)  xd:>job destroy jdbc1 Destroyed job 'jdbc1' xd:>job create jdbc1 --definition "jdbchdfs --columns=ID,FILE_PATH,FILE_NAME,YEAR,FILE_LENGHT,LAST_MODIFIED --tableName=SOMEFILES --checkColumn=ID --partitionColumn=ID --partitions=3 --partitionResultsTimeout=3000000 --rollover=128000000 --commitInterval=1000 --url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//redwood:1521/XE --driverClassName=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver --username=spring --password=spring --testOnBorrow=false" Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Batch Job with the name jdbc1 already exists  xd:>job create jdbc1 --definition "jdbchdfs --columns=ID,FILE_PATH,FILE_NAME,YEAR,FILE_LENGHT,LAST_MODIFIED --tableName=SOMEFILES --checkColumn=ID --partitionColumn=ID --partitions=3 --partitionResultsTimeout=3000000 --rollover=128000000 --commitInterval=1000 --url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//redwood:1521/XE --driverClassName=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver --username=spring --password=spring --testOnBorrow=false" Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Batch Job with the name jdbc1 already exists  xd:>job destroy jdbc1 Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: There is no job definition named 'jdbc1'  xd:>job create jdbc1 --definition "jdbchdfs --columns=ID,FILE_PATH,FILE_NAME,YEAR,FILE_LENGHT,LAST_MODIFIED --tableName=SOMEFILES --checkColumn=ID --partitionColumn=ID --partitions=3 --partitionResultsTimeout=3000000 --rollover=128000000 --commitInterval=1000 --url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//redwood:1521/XE --driverClassName=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver --username=spring --password=spring --testOnBorrow=false" Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Batch Job with the name jdbc1 already exists {code}
R2448. The incremental load introduced with XD-2309 should be added to the batch docs
R2449. Acceptance tests sporadically fail after https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1623 was merged XD-2309.    Additional tests were added but used fixed timeouts.  Will replace them with waitForJob.     
R2450. There are a range of issues (such as XD-3083, XD-2671) that are caused by asynchronous deployments issued by the REST API. The flow of events is:  * deploy/undeploy request received by REST API  * controller queues up request to be processed by supervisor  * controller returns HTTP 2xx    This proposal is to have the thread executing the deploy/undeploy request block until the request has been processed by the supervisor. This will have the side effect of deploys appearing to take longer, but when the HTTP request completes, the deployment/undeployment will have been fulfilled.

R2452. From the latest master, I couldn't run sparkApp as batch job. The spark application process gets launched and it doesn't complete and there are no errors at the output.
R2453. Also provide better lifecycle (shutdown) mgmt of handler.
R2454. As a user I'd like to have shell to automatically configure itself against an environment I have setup.  This really came up with ambari work where shell can be anywhere in a cluster. Best I was able to do for now is to build an init file for commands(ambari xd-shell deploy already knows locations/addresses for xd admin and namenode): {code} $ cat /etc/springxd/conf/xd-shell.init  admin config server http://ambari-2.localdomain:9393 hadoop config fs --namenode hdfs://ambari-2.localdomain:8020 {code}  and then run those after starting xd-shell: {code} server-unknown:>script --file /etc/springxd/conf/xd-shell.init admin config server http://ambari-2.localdomain:9393 Successfully targeted http://ambari-2.localdomain:9393 hadoop config fs --namenode hdfs://ambari-2.localdomain:8020 Script required 0.662 seconds to execute xd:> {code} 
R2455. As a user, I'd like to have the option to gracefully shutdown the stream, so when it is _undeployed_ while in the middle of its operation, we would want to complete its journey to the sink before XD stops the stream.    *Use case:*  One of the streams has a custom module that performs archive extraction. When this stream is ‘undeployed’ while in the middle of extraction, It looks like the message goes to the DLQ. However we would like the message to complete its journey to the sink of the queue before xd stops the stream. Is this possible?
R2456. Using module.name.count > 1 when deploying taps causes duplication of messages in those modules. This impacts balancing of the containers and modules in a cluster as messages should not be duplicated across modules if the same module is deployed twice to two containers in order to spread the load.  We use taps quite heavily in our project mainly for analytics of the life feed in real time but due to issue we have discovered and described in this bug we are currently facing a limitation where heavily processing modules can not be load balanced across the cluster as they are causing duplication of the messages and therefore the same module deployed to two  containers would still process the same message twice.  To demonstrate the problem please see test case scenario set up below:  h4. 1. Environment  - Spring-XD version 1.1.1-RELEASE - Running two spring-xd containers and one spring-xd admin  h4. 2. Set up  Stream definition is as follows:   {quote}stream create --name test-module-count --definition "syslog-udp --port=5140 | transform | log" stream deploy --name test-module-count --properties "module.*.count=2" stream create --name tap-test-module-count --definition "tap:stream:test-module-count.syslog-udp > transform --expression='payload.toString() + \"TAPPED\"' | log" stream deploy --name tap-test-module-count --properties "module.*.count=2"{quote}   Please refer to the screen shots attached to see that after deploying those two streams we have:  - streams successfully deployed ( module-count-spring-xd-streams.png ) - streams successfully deployed with count=2 to both containers ( module-count-spring-xd-containers.png )  - 5 queues created in Rabbit ( module-count-rabbit.png ) where two were created for the syslog-udp collector as a result of using module.syslog-udp.count=2 - this is causing messages to be duplicated. Normally the expectation would be to have only one queue for the tap  h4. 3. Test input data  I have sent a very simple UDP message to the listening udp collector running on second container:   {quote}echo test-module-count >> /dev/udp/host02/5140{quote}  h4. 4. Test output data in the logs ( module-count-container01.log and module-count-container02.log )  h5. Expected result:  Below messages logged only on 1 container (it does not matter which one) {quote}2015-05-26 09:52:21,630 1.1.1.RELEASE  INFO xdbus.test-module-count.1-1 sink.test-module-count - {UNDECODED=test-module-count}{quote} Below message logged only on one container (it does not matter which one)  {quote}2015-05-26 09:52:21,843 1.1.1.RELEASE  INFO xdbus.tap-test-module-count.0-1 sink.tap-test-module-count - {UNDECODED=test-module-count }TAPPED{quote}  h5. Actual result:  Stream that has been create as a tap has duplicated the same message and as a result the same message was proccessed twice on both containers by the same module ( transformer ) and logged twice to the console on both containers  Container01: {quote}2015-05-26 14:52:21,143 1.1.1.RELEASE  INFO xdbus.tap-test-module-count.0-1 sink.tap-test-module-count - {UNDECODED=test-module-count }TAPPED{quote}  Container02: {quote}2015-05-26 09:52:21,630 1.1.1.RELEASE  INFO xdbus.test-module-count.1-1 sink.test-module-count - {UNDECODED=test-module-count } 2015-05-26 09:52:21,843 1.1.1.RELEASE  INFO xdbus.tap-test-module-count.0-1 sink.tap-test-module-count - {UNDECODED=test-module-count }TAPPED{quote}   
R2457. As a developer, I'd like to rerun _baseline_, _Tuple_, and _Serialized_ payloads, so I can compare the differences in performance between 0.8.1 and 0.8.2 Kafka releases.     Sinks to be included in test:  In-Memory Transport > Hdfs sink  Direct Binding Transport > Hdfs Sink  Kafka > Hdfs Sink
R2458. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to 2.0.3 release of Reactor, so I can inherit the latest optimizations to further improve XD performance characteristics. 
R2459. As a developer, I'd like to have JMX turned-off by default, so I can take advantage of the performance throughput benefits. 
R2460. XD-EC2 needs  to allow user to set the XD_JMX_ENABLED flag in the environment prior to admin or container  startups. 
R2461. As a XD build master, I'd like to fix (local ./gradlew dist and distZip targets) the outstanding build issues, so I can evaluate that publish builds works as expected. 
R2462. Identified in a stream of commits ending with:0f4d4ea6b2f16c73c0048e32d8a8753aa25a48fd  Transport: Redis  Admin: 1   Container: 1   Stream deployed: time|file  Attachments: Admin and container logs.  [Description]  Admin reports that File sink Module failed to deploy at 00:19:32 because ZK stated it already exists.  Container shows no deployment of the file sink.  **** This could be an artifact in that the old Acceptance tests use the same stream name, hence a previous undeploy failed to remove the file.  This is not seen in the log per se'.  The filejdbc fail above is a legitimate test verifying that a job can't be deployed twice.

R2464. As a developer, I'd like to clean-up compiler and javadoc warnings from the build, so we don't see  the warnings in build sysout.
R2465. This type is used in password field in the jdbc sink module provided by Spring XD (defined in org.springframework.xd.jdbc.JdbcConnectionMixin class). It seems that Spring XD Admin UI is always displaying the password in plain text please see attached screen shot.  Is there a way to somehow hide the passwords used as module properties in streams from being displayed in Spring XD Admin UI?  This is similar issue as below and fixed in batch jobs but not in streams.  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1325
R2466. https://sonar.spring.io/drilldown/issues/org.springframework.xd:spring-xd?severity=CRITICAL
R2467. Provide unit tests
R2468. RPM scripts will need to change.
R2469. Occasional CI test build failures:    {quote}  Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Container cache not initialized (likely as a result of a ZooKeeper connection error)    org.springframework.util.Assert.state(Assert.java:385)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.container.store.ZooKeeperContainerRepository.ensureCache(ZooKeeperContainerRepository.java:184)    org.springframework.xd.dirt.container.store.ZooKeeperContainerRepository.findOne(ZooKeeperContainerRepository.java:263)  {quote}    e.g. https://build.spring.io/browse/XD-JDK8-JOB1-1514    Add logging to {{ensureCache()}} (e.g. in {{childEvent()}} ) and {{closeCache()}} to log that the cache was closed; it appears that's the only way the "cache not initialized" message can be emitted.
R2470. As a user, I'd like to start multiple instances of {{xd-container}}'s through the RPM scripts, so I can easily spin-up instances on the same node/vm.
R2471. Do as a developer, in the case of large data from the source to the sink will after multiple processors, I found that even if the processor does not do anything, message from the source to the sink of performance, with the number of processors, the message forwarding performance will decrease very much. For example:  spring xd run in  singlenode  After the tcp-client connects the socket service, receive very many text (a line of text messages)  stream definition: tcp-client |t1:transform |t2:transform |t3:transform |t4:transform |null   Message passing rate: 20000 per second Transform didn't do anything.  stream definition: tcp-client|null Message passing rate: 170000 per second  Message is a line of text, my business requires me to a second processing 300000 pieces of data.(About 100 MB/s in a machine )  Tell me how to solve the performance bottleneck. Can stream only have source and sink to get high performance?
R2472. Private keys do not require pass phrases; hence it's bogus for the source to require one.
R2473. when use rabbit as source, always have the warn message: skipping header 'amqp_deliveryMode' since it is not of expected type [class org.springframework.amqp.core.MessageDeliveryMode], it is [class org.springframework.amqp.core.MessageDeliveryMode]  similar issure is https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-2567,  but i have no use rabbit sink.
R2474. Refactoring of the {{ResourceDeployer}} to split apart the concepts of repository and deployment. For reference see XD-2835, XD-2671, XD-2877 and XD-3070.
R2475. `minPartitionCount` is ignored by the consumer, so downstream modules end up listening to fewer partitions
R2476. Currently kryo class registration is hard coded in spring-xd-codec. Users may register their own classes using an extension mechanism, but it is possible to conflict with internal XD class registration, e.g., Tuple. Exposing this using the same extension mechanism will make it more transparent. 
R2477. This is an enhancement to KryoClassRegistrar or a related mechanism to initialize codecs using custom serializers to improve serialization performance. Currently XD will support POJOs that implement the kryo Serializable interface to gain a 2x performance improvement, however initial benchmarks show that custom serializers are about 10% more performant than Serializable.
R2478. As a user, I'd like to refer to OOTB batch jobs and the documentation, so I can jump to the right job section and review details. 
R2479. Starting teh shell without having admin running on localhost:9393 results in the following message:  {code} 1.2.0.RC1 | Admin Server Target: http://localhost:9393 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Error: Unable to contact XD Admin Server at 'http://localhost:9393'.

R2480. Since `Spark-streaming` uses `BusUtils`, we need to move the bus cleaner util method that builds rest template so that spark streaming doesn't depend on `httpClient`
R2481. Since Spark streaming doesn't use ZK to keep track taps being created, we don't need the tap listener cache setup at the container startup.

R2491. When a custom module is uploaded to module registry, though the module registry is updated with the changed module after deleting the existing one, the module changes aren't loaded when deployed.
R2492. Spring Integration MBeans are enabled by default even though XD_JMX_ENABLED is set to false. We need to disable JMX on these MBeans as well as Spring Boot MBeans.
R2493. There are more calculations done at the RuntimeModuleDeploymentPropertiesProvider implementations and would be good to have some tests to cover them.
R2494. As a developer, I would like to be able to configure which exceptions thrown by a module should be retryable within the {{RabbitMessageBus}}.  As usual, these should be configurable at the bus and/or stream deployment property level.  Also consider disabling retry for kryo deserialization problems. ----  We are running Spring XD with RabbitMQ transport and we'd like to have a way to stop retries in certain situations. In [Spring XD 1.2.0.RC1 docs|http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-xd/1.2.0.RC1/reference/html/], in chapter about RabbitMQ transport, in "A Note About Retry" section, it's written:  {quote}Message deliveries failing with a MessageConversionException (perhaps when using a custom converterClassName) are never retried; the assumption being that if a message could not be converted on the first attempt, subsequent attempts will also fail.{quote}  Following is unclear: # Are we speaking about {{org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConversionException}} or {{org.springframework.amqp.support.converter.MessageConversionException}}? Based on XD-1597 and AMQP-390 it's the latter. # Only {{org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConversionException}} is available for custom module developers. Attempting to throw {{org.springframework.amqp.support.converter.MessageConversionException}} which is provided by {{$XD_HOME/lib/messagebus/rabbit/spring-amqp-1.4.5.RELEASE.jar}} results in {{java.lang.ClassNotFoundException}} even after Spring XD is configured to use {{rabbit}} transport. # Throwing  {{org.springframework.messaging.converter.MessageConversionException}} from custom processor module written with Spring Integration's {{transformer}} or {{service-activator}} doesn't stop retries.
R2495. h2. Narrative  As a developer, I'd like a job module to be bootstrapped when the job is launched and shut down once it is complete instead of the current behavior of bootstrapping the context when the module is deployed regardless of if it's being used so that I can achieve better resource utilization.    h2. Back story  While streams are never ending, batch jobs have a true lifecycle with a beginning and and end.  By having a job bootstrapped when it's not executing, it eats up precious resources.  For example, if I have a job that creates connections to a database via a connection pool, the job module will hold those connections from the moment it's deployed to the moment it's undeployed, even if the job isn't being executed.  A more efficient use of resources would be to have the job module provide just enough to receive the launch request and then bootstrap the job's context    h2.  Notes  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q964adRCA-kJke_i0GBToJHLXJJTV_7TaTpQT0ymsbc/edit
R2496. h2. Narrative  As a developer, when using jdbchdfs's incremental imports, I need to be notified that something went wrong in a previous run of the jdbchdfs job so that I can take the appropriate actions based on the data previously imported.    h2.  Back story  As the incremental import currently works, if the job fails half way through, there is no check on the next run to see if the last run failed or not and how to address partially imported data.
R2497. h2. Narrative  As a developer, I want to be able to construct jobs using a DSL similar to the current syntax for streams.    h2.  Back story  Streams currently provide a DSL for assembling modules into flows (streams) that consist of a source, n processors, and a sink.  While constructing the steps of jobs themselves would be difficult in this manor, creating flows of jobs (essentially a job that consists only of job steps) would be very useful.  It would allow a developer to create something like the following:    {code}  filejdbc | mycustomjob | jdbchdfs  {code}    This approach also allows the existing packaging/module registry/etc to work out of the box.  This gets us closer to what Oozie provides out of the box without the need to create custom jobs to do the orchestration.

R2505. As a developer I would like to create DSL based jobs using Spring XD.   Currently BatchJobRegistryBeanPostProcessor implementation has an assumption in postProcessAfterInitialization( ) method (line 92). It checks if the beans are instanceof StepParserStepFactoryBean which is XML based steps. Therefore any XD step listeners for tap events are not getting registered, effectively I'm not getting any Step events out of my DSL based jobs.  Apparently everything else is working alright for the Java DSL job. Java DSL jobs are far easier to write Test/Integration Tests with.  Please review issue type - I was not sure if this was a bug or improvement, i supposed it is an improvement. 
R2506. As a developer, I in the new development of component (source/processor/sink), how to get the module id and container id  Because components need to generate log, log information must include the unique identifier   xd:>runtime modules 
R2507. When querying the *ModuleMetadataRepository*, the *ModuleOptions* in class *ModuleMetadata*  are currently only provided as *properties*. This is a problem in cases where I need to determine the type of the property.   For instance, security sensitive properties should not be exposed verbatim but rather be masked.   Right now it seems impossible (easily) to determine whether a property is e.g. of type:  *org.springframework.xd.module.options.types.Password*    
R2508. The various methods is ModuleUtils sometimes create module classloaders just for the sake of loading a single file. URLClassLoader are now closeable, which we should try to do, but not too early.  Some of the signatures in that class are problematic (esp the ones that return a Resource) because we don't know when the client will be done with that resource. So we can't close the underlying CL for them.  Investigate other approaches:  * callback style signatures (ie doWithClassLoader(cl) for certain cases)  * global CL caching mechanism per module type:name  (but then issues arise when module bytecode is changed, etc)
R2509. Sort alphabetically, nest "Available modules" section appropriately. Optionally, move to a whole different "PART" in reference doc

R2511. Kafka deployments take nearly 4 times as long as other transports because of the creation of the topic an partitions.  Currently all test use the same wait time whether it is for waiting for connections or file writes.   So to get a CI build for kafka build would take a long period of time.  The goal of the Story is to allow deployments to have a different pause_time to give Kafka bus the extra time it needs but not affect the timeout for other stages of the tests.    
R2512. As a developer, I want to be able to override Kafka bus defaults for module consumers and producers, so that I can finely tune performance and behaviour.     Such properties should include  - autoCommitEnabled,queueSize,maxWait,fetchSize for consumers  - batchSize,batchTimeout for producers

R2519. From https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/1704  I am trying to use composed modules when running on YARN.

R2525. When the bus is used outside of the XD container (e.g. spring-bus), the inheritance from Spring Boot configuration is broken (no application.yml or servers.yml on the cp).    Make the bus properties optional (Add ":")
R2526. If we export HADOOP_DISTRO env var instead of using --hadoopDistro parameter then the logging message is wrong, it always says    Hadoop Distro: hadoop26    even if we set HADOOP_DISTRO to something else    The classpath is built correctly. Maybe we should just remove this logging message since we log the actual version used in the next log message.  
R2527. Now that Boot (1.3) supports SSL (and other settings), we can remove the {{ConnectionFactorySettings}} {{@Configuration}}.

R2529. Currently when running the {{p-spring-xd}} stream tests, we run into an issue where the XD Container starts throwing errors because it cannot open the module configuration file.  This happens reliably after 3-4 days of running and always fails on the same {{modules.yml}} configuration file.  This is not to say that the file leak is guaranteed to be related to the {{modules.yml}}, but it's certainly a place to start looking.  A restart of the container (only) causes the error to go away for 3-4 days at which point it reappears, indicating that the problem is definitely in the XD Container and not in the operating system's configuration.

R2530. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/modules/common/gemfire-connection.groovy#L8 is syntactically incorrect. It looks like the intention was to pass this a property, but it appears it is treated as a literal value which Groovy coerces to true. Thus subscription-enabled is always true. It should be configurable  although some modules require subscription-enabled to be true. 
R2531. Spring Boot 1.2.4 (and earlier) does not allow for the retrieval of boolean values from the vcap environment. This means that when XD Admin tries to retrieve the value of (for example) {{vcap.services.rabbitmq.credentials.protocols.amqp.ssl}} it will fail, as that value returns a boolean.    Spring Boot 1.2.5 (as yet unreleased) contains a fix for this issue (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/pull/3237)
R2532. We need to add the settings needed to run XD on YARN when using Hortonworks HDP 2.2.6.0 which is the version you now get when installing with Ambari.
R2533. It isn't obvious from looking through the table of contents on the left hand side that reactor-ip does both tcp and udp.  Breaking up the section into two  would make it more clear - even though they would still use the same module.
R2534. There are cases where it would be required to load the options metadata classes from the parent classloader *first* than the module's ParentLastURLClassLoader. It would be nice to have a configuration option in DefaultModuleOptionsResolver to set which classloader to use.
R2535. The admin leader starts cleaning up the deployments for the container(s) that is/are no longer connected to the ZK. This clean up needs to happen after the container path cache is started by the admin leader. 
R2536. In the {{filejdbc}} job, there is the option to delete the imported files.  This functionality is created using a listener called the {{FileDeletionStepExecutionListener}}.  When you run the job the first time with the {{--deleteFiles=true}}, everything works as expected.  The second time you run the job, the files are not deleted.    I believe the issue here is that since the {{FileDeletionStepExecutionListener}} is a singleton, the resources are resolved only once (the first time the job runs) and so it works the first time, but if the job is run again later and new files match the expression, they are not picked up.  I believe the fix is to make the {{FileDeletionStepExecutionListener}} used in this job step scoped.
R2537. User's need ability to wait for user specified time in millis for a file to be created in the XD directory.  If file is not created in allotted time then return false else return true.  Also check to see if a file exists in the XD directory.  
R2538. I am trying to deploy a job I destroyed after running a few times. I removed all the jobs using job all destroy. When i try to recreate the same name job it is saying it already exists. JobController.java save() method is throwing the exception if job exists in Job Repository database, but they are gone from job definition list. These jobs were originally created using XD Template REST client dynamically, but that should not make any difference.  This leaves me in an inconsistent state between XD definitions/job repository. How do I get rid of the job without having to log in to the database and play with the job repository tables.  I had to delete data folder for myself to continue development.   There should be a force mechanism to recreate a job with the same name, a flag that by passes this validation against the repository or overwrites the information in the repository.  
R2539. As a user, I'd like to have the module/app specific metrics consumed directly from Boot actuator [export()|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/autoconfigure/MetricRepositoryAutoConfiguration.java] API, so I can have insight on how it is performing, being used and that it works etc.    
R2540. As a developer, I'd like to handle module options via pure boot property source management, so I can leverage Boot's module [METADATA|http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-metadata] option to inject module options as opposed to maintaining them in core Spring XD runtime CP.  
R2541. As a developer, I'd like to have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all the environments, so I can provide server and client-side support for externalized configuration for XD-Admin and XD-Container servers. 
R2542. As a developer, I'd like to troubleshoot the performance issues with Rabbit as message bus implementation, so I can isolate the bottleneck and fix as appropriate.
R2543. As a developer, I'd like to migrate the current MASTER branch CI builds to EC2 instances, so I can manage them all in one-place reliably.
R2544. As a developer, I'd like to add an option to support Apache Ambari installed Spring XD on YARN, so I can easily establish the cluster up and running.
R2545. As a developer, I'd like to use spring-cloud-config server for spring-bus modules, so I can centrally manage external properties.
R2546. As a developer, I'd like to split up spring-xd dependencies to more fine-grained, so I can get the ones "below the line" down to spring-bus-* instead of spring-xd-* bundle. 
R2547. As a user, I'm trying to delete the custom module using the {{module delete}} command via shell; though the command is successfully, I'm still seeing the associated artifact (_.jar file_) present in the custom_modules folder. Refer to [SO thread|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30984922/springxd-module-delete-command-does-not-delete-the-uploaded-jar-file] for more details.    
R2548. According to the documentation at: http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/current/reference/html/#reactor-ip one of the options available for this source is {{transport}}. It's listed as having no default, but the sample definition doesn't provide it yet appears to default to {{tcp}}. The two should match up.  It might also be useful if the possible values for {{transport}} were listed (I assume {{TCP}} and {{UDP}})
R2549. As a developer, I'd like to investigate channel performance issues in SI 4.2, so I can determine the bottlenecks and take corrective actions to improve overall channel performance. 
R2550. As a developer, I'd like to measure the baseline serialization characteristics in XD, so I can determine the areas of performance improvements. 
R2551. As a spring-bus lead, I'd like to review the current spring-bus architecture and the design specs, so I can address any foundation level gaps.
R2552. As a user, I'd like to upgrade Spring XD from 1.2 RC to 1.2 GA using the Ambari plugin, so I can work on the latest release bits. I'd like to refer to the documentation to do so.
R2553. Here is an error I got using the header-enricher from spring-xd-modules :      {code:java}  Field error in object 'info' on field 'shortDescription': rejected value [A Header Enricher to set message headers in a stream]; codes [Pattern.info.shortDescription,Pattern.shortDescription,Pattern.java.lang.String,Pattern]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [info.shortDescription,shortDescription]; arguments []; default message [shortDescription],[Ljavax.validation.constraints.Pattern$Flag;@11eeec65,^\p{IsUppercase}.*\.$]; default message [Short description must start with a capital letter and end with a dot]  {code}    And if I look the config properties, indeed, short description doesn't end with a dot.  {code:java}  info.shortDescription = A Header Enricher to set message headers in a stream  {code}
R2554. As per [Chapter 3: Logback configuration|http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html] only XML configuration can be overidden with {{-test}} file. It's impossible to do this with groovy configuration.  There are Spring XD modules that are packaging {{logback.groovy}} e.g. {{spring-xd-extension-sqoop}}. If a custom module depends on those libraries it becomes impossible to nicely override log settings for tests\[1\]. The configuration is taken from classpath because {{logback.groovy}} is always prioritized over {{logback-test.xml}}.  If those modules would switch to {{logback.xml}} there will be no such problem and custom modules would be easier to set up.  \[1\] One can put own {{logback.groovy}} file under {{src/test/resources}} but this setup will output a number of warning into console. Forcing logback configuration path with {{-D}} option is not nice either.
R2555. With version 1.2.0 the option ref of the file source was removed and a new option mode was introduced.  see XD-2850 and PR  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1624.  This means you have to destroy all streams using the ref option before you do an upgrade.  It would have been much better to leave the ref option in the code and emit a deprecation warning if it is still used. This way an upgrade would be possible without interruption.     
R2556. Custom Spring XD modules are packaged into a JAR file with 3rd party libraries packaged into {{lib}} folder.  Let's say we have a {{my-job}} custom job module, packaged as JAR and deployed with {{module upload}} shell command. It wants to use {{org.springframework.xd.sqoop.SqoopTasklet}} provided by {{spring-xd-extension-sqoop}} library. Unfortunately {{org.springframework.batch.step.tasklet.x.ClasspathEnvironmentProvider}} will only add {{my-job.jar}} to {{SqoopRunner}} classpath (code in {{ClasspathEnvironmentProvider#createClassPath()}} method).  {{ClasspathEnvironmentProvider}} should add all 3rd party JARs packaged in custom job module to classpath.  This works with {{sqoop}} module shipped with Spring XD because it's deployed as "exploded" module under $XD_HOME/modules/job. In such case {{ClasspathEnvironmentProvider}} correctly adds all JARs from $XD_HOME/modules/job/sqoop/lib to classpath.
R2557. This deprecated in SI 4.2.  Use   {{this.evaluationContext = ExpressionUtils.createStandardEvaluationContext(getBeanFactory());}}  in {{afterPropertiesSet()}} instead.  Not that this can safely be done in 1.2.x - the preferred mechanism is available in SI 4.1.x too.
R2558. As a user I would like to use fsUri = file:// to use Hadoop LocalFileSystem instead of a running cluster. In my use case my data scientist team requested to provide me a local CSV of data that is being loaded using jdbchdfs job. The quickest way to solve this was to change the fsUri to file://. and it should have just worked.   This will work alright for singlenode setups, for multiple containers hosted on multiple machines will split the file across different machines - but then I believe it is fair to assume that the developer must know what he is doing.
R2559. Should be renamed as well. org.springframework.integration.transformer.MessageTransformationException: ; nested exception is org.springframework.messaging.MessageHandlingException: ; nested exception is org.springframework.expression.spel.SpelEvaluationException: EL1004E:(pos 8): Method call: Method toObject(java.util.LinkedHashMap) cannot be found on org.springframework.integration.x.gemfire.JsonStringToObjectTransformer type   org.springframework.integration.transformer.MessageTransformingHandler.handleRequestMessage(MessageTransformingHandler.java:74) ~[spring-integration-core-4.1.5.RELEASE.jar:na]   org.springframework.integration.handler.AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler.handleMessageInternal(AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler.java:99) ~[spring-integration-core-4.1.5.RELEASE.jar:na]   org.springframework.integration.handler.AbstractMessageHandler.handleMessage(AbstractMessageHandler.java:78) ~[spring-integration-core-4.1.5.RELEASE.jar:na] (...) with 1.2 RELEASE when trying to persist a JSON payload using the GemFire-json-server sink.. It works  great on 1.1.RELEASE and 1.2 Build snapshot 2015-04-23.001857    The demo repository is open, so I can definitely share it with your developers, but wondered if we changed something recently on that sink that could cause an issue.
R2560. When profiling metrics we noticed a small improvement when using Deque instead of LinkedList in ExponentialMovingAverageRatio, ExponentialMovingAverageRate...  
R2561. After enabling Spring XD security in {{XD_HOME/config/servers.yml}}:    {code}  spring:    profiles: admin  security:    basic:      enabled: true      realm: SpringXD  xd:    security:      authentication:        file:          enabled: true          users:            user: password, ROLE_VIEW            admin: password, ROLE_VIEW, ROLE_CREATE, ROLE_ADMIN  {code}    after logging in as {{user}} with only {{ROLE_VIEW}} privilege, Jobs admin page is broken and is not displaying data. 403 error code is returned for following URLs:    {code}  http://localhost:9393/jobs/configurations.json?page=0&size=10  http://localhost:9393/jobs/definitions.json?page=0&size=10  {code}    Looks like {{/jobs/configurations.\*}} and {{/jobs/definitions.\*}} URLs are not covered in security section of applications.yml file.
R2562. As a user, I'd like to have the option to specify system properties that will be passed in to the Sqoop job which runs in it's own Java process. This is needed for defining memory usage and also for defining some options for various connector implementations.
R2563. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/1727
R2564. As a user, I'm trying to connect to {{xd-admin}} server with basic security enabled; however, I'm unable to successfully connect to the server and I get the following error message.      {code:java}  server-unknown:>admin config server --uri http://localhost:9393 --username bob --password bobspwd  Unable to contact XD Admin Server at 'http://localhost:9393'.  {code}
R2565. The admin leader election fails when the stream/job module definitions doesn't exist in `module-registry` but still some of the references still exist in ZK (via some of the previous deployments that had this module in module registry).     Though this is expected, this behavior will make *all* the subsequent deployments in *deploying* state because the admin leader isn't elected.    
R2566. Since the SecuredShellTests initialize singlenode app in a static way, the random configuration needs to be setup statically as well.
R2567. After enabling security (see XD-3214) and granting user {{ROLE_VIEW, ROLE_CREATE, ROLE_ADMIN}} privileges it's not possible to launch jobs from Admin UI.     For {{bdl-sqoop-combo-lukasz-MONGO-DEV}} job, 403 error is returned when Admin UI attempts to access following URL after "Launch Job" button is pressed:  {code}  http://ilabphd12.isus.emc.com:9393/jobs/executions?jobParameters=%7B%7D&jobname=bdl-sqoop-combo-lukasz-MONGO-DEV  {code}    Please see attached screenshot.

R2569. As a user I would like to connect the Sqoop batch job to Teradata for import jobs.     I have tried the Teradata JDBC driver directly using:    {code}job create tdTest --definition "sqoop --command=import --args='--table Frequent_Flyers --connect jdbc:teradata://tdexpress/DATABASE=transportation --driver com.teradata.jdbc.TeraDriver --username dbc --password dbc --target-dir=/xd/teradata --num-mappers 1'"  {code}    but that results in an NPE.    The only way so far is to use the Hortonworks Connector for Teradata - http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/HDP/tools/2.2.4.2/hdp-connector-for-teradata-1.3.4.2.2.4.2-2-distro.tar.gz    That one allows me to use the following:    {code}job create tdTest --definition "sqoop --command=import --args='--table Frequent_Flyers --connect jdbc:teradata://tdexpress/DATABASE=transportation --connection-manager org.apache.sqoop.teradata.TeradataConnManager --username dbc --password dbc --target-dir=/xd/teradata --num-mappers 1'"  {code}
R2570. As a user I would like to be able to configure the logging directory to be outside of what is defined as xd.home. The logging directory is currently hard coded as {code}${xd.home}/logs{code}.    This would be useful for RPM installations where the logs really should be going to `/var/logs/spring-xd` instead of the current `/opt/pivotal/spring-xd/xd/logs` location.  
R2571. As a developer, I'd like to move message-bus from Spring XD repo into spring-bus, so I can update Spring XD to inherit the features/functionalities via maven dependency.   
R2572. As a developer, I'd like to move 'input/output type conversion' from Spring XD repo into spring-bus, so I can update Spring XD to inherit the features/functionalities via maven dependency. 
R2573. As a developer, I'd like to move 'serialization codec' from Spring XD repo into spring-bus, so I can update Spring XD to inherit the features/functionalities via maven dependency.
R2574. As a developer, I'd like to develop a “singlenode�? (in a single JVM) implementation of XD Admin SPI (based on Module Launcher), so I can run data pipeline use-cases locally.  
R2575. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to use Diego based Receptor implementation of XD Admin SPI (based on ModuleLauncher), so I can run data pipeline use-cases running on CF Lattice/Diego.   
R2576. As a s-c-s user, I'd like to investigate the possibility of s-c-s modules self-registering themselves to service discovery, so I could use Spring XD runtime (running on CF) to discover and orchestrate such modules through streams.
R2577. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to Reactor 2.0.4 release, so I could leverage the latest improvements and bug-fixes.
R2578. As a developer, I'd like to update Ambari installed Spring XD cluster to spin-up multiple instances of XD-Admin servers, so it is setup for HA. 
R2579. Also Spring Framework 4.2.0.RC2, Spring AMQP 1.5.0.M1    Also Batch 3.0.4
R2580. As a developer, I'd like to create an annotation ({{@EnableModule}}) driven programming model for modules, so instead of explicitly defining I/O channels as beans on the module, for classes annotated with {{@EnableModule}}, the application would be responsible for creating the actual channel beans and channel adapters vs. the developer creating concrete channel instance types.    The {{@Input}} and {{@Output}} annotations will be used to indicate the input and output channels of the module. 
R2581. The XML REST endpoints:  * are not working correctly * interfere with security * are not used   
R2582. Currently the testFileJdbcJobMultipleInvocations fails on line 156 stating data is different in table that what is expected.  Currently this is failing on the single admin/container deployment using redis as a transport.      Also seeing the following exception in the attached log:  {noformat}  2.0.0.SNAP ERROR xdbus.job:ec2Job3.0.requests-1 step.AbstractStep - Encountered an error executing step step1 in job ec2Job3  org.springframework.batch.item.ItemStreamException: Failed to initialize the reader  ...

R2584. As a developer, I'd like to complete the remaining Kryo optimization changes, so I can polish and get the guidelines documented appropriately. 
R2585. As a developer, I'd like to move 1.2.x branch to EC2 infrastructure, so I can reliably run CI test suites.
R2586. Currently only database connection info can be read from a control file yml format. Should add rest of the missing options to align how native format works.
R2587. Currently we can only do plain inserts, should follow same logic from native gpfdist sink and add upserts.
R2588. Create the equivalent library in spring-cloud-streams
R2589. replace with spring-cloud-streams (or spring-cloud-streams-codec) dependency
R2590. XD 2.0 will not have direct dependency on the s-c-s Binder (as MB has been renamed).  The message bus code is obsolete/orphaned in XD 2.0 but some is required to support current integration tests. We can look at pruning it some more but complete removal likely depends on integrating the s-c-s enabled Admin SPI.  MB will remain in XD 1.x.
R2591. It would be nice if either one of the two options would come "for free" when you're authoring a module. Currently, it has been a pain, including handling exclusivity of options at the module options level.  Also, it would be nice if XD/S-C-S provided ease of creation of xxExpression style options (ie not having the author have to deal with ExpressionParser, etc)
R2592. Working with rich structured messages is currently painful when we have modules that know how to handle some sub-part of the structure.  Case in point: I have a Tuple made of {document: byte[], metadata: Map} and I have a module that knows how to extract textual content from the document byte[].  If I want to extract the document but still retain metadata, I need to either - rewrite the extract content module to accept a tuple (urghh) - fork the stream to extract the document field, apply module, aggregate with metadata (that comes from side channel)  
R2593. These tests fail inconsistently:  org.springframework.xd.spark.streaming.LocalTransportSparkStreamingTests > testTapSparkProcessor FAILED    java.lang.AssertionError  org.springframework.xd.spark.streaming.RedisTransportSparkStreamingTests > testTapSparkProcessor FAILED    java.lang.AssertionError  java.lang.AssertionError:  Expected: an existing metric, trying at most 20 times     but: failed after 20*100=2000ms: counter named 'random5656' did not exist,
R2594. This better aligns with boot. Moreover, using Class was a bad design choice (one can always get a Class from a String [modulo knowing which CL to use], while to converse is not always easy [CL not being available])  
R2595. The spring-cloud-streams samples have module options classes copied over from XD.  They should use a pure @ConfigurationProperties approach, making sure metadata is generated/hand written as appropriate.    @Mixins are still referenced there but obviously can't work, so provide an equivalent
R2596. This allows incremental adoption of boot @ConfigurationProperties as a way of being recognized as XD options
R2597. This is to get rid of (ultimately) ModuleOption, ModuleOptionsMetadataResolver etc in favor of classes written by Stéphane Nicoll (currently here: https://github.com/snicoll-scratches/spring-boot-config/blob/master/spring-boot-config-metadata/src/main/java/org/springframework/configurationmetadata/)
R2598. Looking at the online docs the code listings have inconsistent  syntax highlighting and when you hover the mouse over some of them there is a language  prefix like ruby or javascript inserted at the beginning of the first line. Very strange.  To see this go to http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.2.0.RELEASE/reference/html/#_server_configuration and scroll down to the HSQLDB section. The listing for HSQLDB looks fine, but scroll down further and put the mouse pointer on the MySQL or PostgreSQL listings and you should see 'javascript' being inserted on the first line. 
R2599. As a developer, I'd like to brainstorm and investigate various techniques around installation of XD modules from a maven repo, so I could define the module {{artifactId}} from CLI to have the module downloaded from the repo and installed to a running Spring XD runtime.
R2600. After connecting to admin endpoint over HTTPS xd-shell will use plain HTTP for all further calls, which fails if HTTPS is mandatory:  {code} server-unknown:>admin config server https://my-host/ Successfully targeted https://my-host/ xd:>job list Command failed org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on GET request for "http://my-host/jobs/definitions?size=10000&deployments=true":Connection refused; nested exception is java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused {code}  In above example {{my-host}} is a proxy that provides load balancing and enforces HTTPS for users. It forwards the traffic to to spring-xd-admin service REST API over regular HTTP and port 9393. Admin service is returning {{_links}} with plain HTTP because it's unaware of the network proxy.  Can this be solved without employing server side HTTP->HTTPS url rewrite? Is enabling SSL in spring-xd-admin the only way?
R2601. We need to have some jars as part of the Sqoop job submission to YARN:    for Avro we need:    avro-1.7.6.jar    avro-mapred-1.7.6.jar    for Snappy we need:    snappy-java-1.0.5.jar (note: the 1.1.0.1 version from xd/lib doesn't work)    commons-compress-1.4.1.jar    We can either have these included using the --libjars option or automatically include them.  
R2602. replace with xd.messagebus prefix with spring.cloud.stream.binder
R2603. As a developer, I'd like to move 'serialization codec' from Spring XD repo into SI, so I can update Spring XD to inherit the features/functionalities via maven dependency.
R2604. There is a vulnerability in Groovy that is fixed in 2.4.4:    CVE-2015-3253: Remote execution of untrusted code    See:    http://groovy-lang.org/security.html    http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-groovy-users/201507.mbox/%3CCADQzvmmYC7RbZnsQ8O63XN4HCMYh9RGRdMiuWupVt=u=pjH8+g@mail.gmail.com%3E      
R2605. Add Pagination to Containers Page
R2606. Hi ,    Customer has 48 containers, but it only shows 20 containers. We need pagination to browse all containers.
R2607. {{spring-data-commons}} 1.10.0.RELEASE introduced an improved instantiation strategy based on byte code generation. It's now the default instantiation strategy however it can't be used in custom Spring XD modules due to class loader issues.

R2608. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to use {{CloudController}} based implementation of XD Admin SPI (based on ModuleLauncher), so I can run data pipeline use-cases running on CF.    Relevant repos: [spring-cloud-data|https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-data/tree/master/spring-cloud-data-module-deployers] | [spring-cloud-stream|https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream]    Please refer to XD-3194 or XD-3229 as sample spike-deliverables (_google doc_) that were completed in the last sprint. 
R2609. After successfully deploying 12 jobs the Jobs / Deployments page still shows only 10 results.    It looks like {{http://localhost:9393/jobs/configurations.json?page=0&size=10}} always returns {{content.page.totalPages}} of 1 regardless of the {{size}} parameter.
R2610. As a Spring XD on CF user, I'd like to use Receptor implementation of Admin SPI every time I deploy Spring XD modules, so I can leverage the SPI to query for module status and health metrics.    *Possible APIs:*  {code}    ModuleStatus getStatus(ModuleDescriptor descriptor);    Collection<ModuleDescriptor> listModules();    Map<ModuleDescriptor.Key, ModuleStatus>    {code}
R2611. As a Spring XD on CF user, I'd like to use {{cloudController}} implementation of Admin SPI every time I deploy Spring XD modules, so I can leverage the SPI to query for module status and health metrics.  *Possible APIs:* {code}  ModuleStatus getStatus(ModuleDescriptor descriptor);  Collection<ModuleDescriptor> listModules();  Map<ModuleDescriptor.Key, ModuleStatus>  {code}
R2612. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to have a permanent location of SPI implementations, so I could use the common repo every time I contribute or enhance the test coverage.  
R2613. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to create initial version of the new module registry abstraction, so we could leverage the foundation to make progress and test the respective SPI ({{receptor}} or {{cloudcontroller}}) implementations.
R2614. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to make SPI implementation profile aware, so I can run {{java -jar admin}} or {{cf push}} admin or {{ltc create admin}} and the corresponding implementation gets wired-in automatically.
R2615. As a s-c-s user, I'd like to have the modules self-register itself with {{Eureka}} whenever they're installed, so I can also discover the same modules using Spring XD Admin SPI and reuse them to create data pipelines. 
R2616. As a s-c-s user, I'd like to search the modules by it's name aside from the default {{spring.application.name}} offered by boot, so I can also fetch modules by it's name.
R2617. As a s-c-s user, I'd like to store module metadata in {{Eureka}}, so I can use the repository to determine the current state.
R2618. As a s-c-s user, I'd like to have my modules add/update it's current state to Eureka, so I can use the repository to discover the current sate of the module as needed.   
R2619. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to refactor current controller with SPI calls, so I can invoke the respective Admin SPI implementation based on the deployment.     *Controllers to Refactor*  * ContainersController  * StreamsController  * ModulesController  * JobsController  
R2620. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to capture module (aka: {{cf apps}}) metrics directly, so I can relay that information via REST-APIs and not depend on the current coupling of {{xd-container}}'s.    Currently, there are two different ways we could consume this information from applications. SI's {{channel()}} and SBoot's {{actuator()}} APIs are the few to explore as part of this scope.
R2621. Occasionally 2 acceptance tests are running simultaneously and the filepollhdfs tests writes their data to the same hdfs directory.  This will cause the test to fail sporadically.  By creating a unique directory each time we can share the hadoop instance and not have a conflict.   
R2622. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to self-register {{xd-admin}} server with {{Eureka}}, so I could have admin server exposed as discoverable endpoint. 
R2623. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to setup CI builds for s-c-s builds, so I can incrementally build and test code commits automatically.
R2624. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to port {{FTP/SFTP}} modules from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use them as {{source}} modules to build streaming pipeline.
R2625. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to persist module (aka: {{cf apps}}) metrics directly, so I can relay that information via REST-APIs and not depend on the current coupling of {{xd-container}}'s.    Currently, SBoot's {{export()}} API allows us to snapshot metrics (default = {{redis}}) on a specific interval (default = {{5s}}). This could be something to explore as part of this scope.
R2626. As a user, I'm trying to setup HA cluster using Ambari installed Spring XD; however, I'm running into issues with the overrides. More details [here|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-ambari/issues/6].
R2627. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to setup a CI workflow to build, bundle and upload the {{module-launcher}} image to DockerHub, so I don't have to worry about having a local-private docker registry for development/testing.    It could be nice to have the image uploaded to existing [spring-cloud|https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/springcloud/] DockerHub location. 
R2628. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to have [IPython Notebook|http://ipython.org/notebook.html] integration, so I can perform interactive data computations in real-time.
R2629. As a Azure user, I'd like to read/write data from Azure Event Hubs. so I can leverage the pub-sub service to process and analyze large volumes of data.
R2630. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to have IPython Notebook integration, so I can perform interactive data computations in real-time.  
R2631. As an operator, I'd like to upgrade to the latest releases of Spring XD and yet not lose the older installation {{dirs}}/{{files}}, so I can copy and reuse the previously used {{servers.yml}} configurations. 
R2632. h2. Narrative  As a developer, I'd like to be able to configure common dependencies for the entire environment.  An example could be that I use MySql for my databases.  I want to be able to configure the MySql driver once and have all modules use it.    h2. Back story  Spring Batch uses a database to store job state (the job repository).  This is a shared resource across all jobs (both custom developed and OOTB).  In order to support OOTB jobs, we'll need to have a way for users to provide the db driver to each module.  Ideally this would be possible without requiring that each of our OOTB modules be repackaged.  
R2633. h2. Narrative  As a developer, I'd like to be able to run a boot jar as a task on CF and obtain the result reliably.    h2. Back story  Currently Lattice/Diego's tasks implementation provides the ability to run things as short lived tasks.  However, obtaining the result of said task can be an issue.  There are two ways to do so:    # Poll for the result.  # Register a callback URL to be called once the task completes.    Since a task is only available for a short time after its completion before it is deleted, polling can run the risk of missing the result completely.  When you consider the fact that the provided GUIDs that identify tasks can be re-used polling becomes a precarious option.    Registering a callback URL would be a better option, however there are no good guarantees that the message will be delivered.  The service will try to execute the callback until it's successful or the task is cleaned up.  "Successful" is defined in this case as anything other than a 502 or a 503 return code.    In order for Spring XD to be able to support Diego tasks, a more durable option for maintaining the result of tasks will need to be developed.    *Note:* The outcome of this spike may be feature requests for the CF/Diego team.
R2634. h2. Narrative  As a developer, when running a batch job on Diego/Lattice as a task, I want to be able to receive events based on the job lifecycle.    h2. Back story  XD 1.x provides exposure to all of the main listeners Spring Batch supports via streams so they can be listened to.  This needs to be supported in the new spring-cloud-streams model.    *Note:* We may want this to depend on XD-2841?
R2635. h2. Narrative  As Spring XD, I will be able to launch Spring Boot jar files as Diego Tasks.    h2. Back story  The {{TaskLauncher}} will be responsible for listening for launch requests, looking up the definition in the {{TaskDescriptorRepository}}, and launching it.  The first implementation of this would be a Receptor based implementation.    *See:* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q964adRCA-kJke_i0GBToJHLXJJTV_7TaTpQT0ymsbc/edit
R2636. h2. Narrative  As a developer, I need to be able to create a partitioned batch job that uses Diego Tasks for partition slaves.    h2. Back story  A new partition handler should be created that uses the Receptor API to launch tasks for each of the slaves (configurable via grid size).
R2637. h2. Narrative  As a developer, I need to be able to run batch jobs that use the centrally configured job repository to store job state.    h2. Back story  The XD containers each used a {{BatchConfigurer}} implementation ({{RuntimeBatchConfigurer}}) to add a consistent configuration for the job repository.  This functionality needs to be replicated in some way in just a regular Spring Boot application.
R2638. We need better controll over how config files are preserved during upgrades. The RPM process handles that better for files that are designated as %config and they should reside outside of the directory where the software is installed so they can be kept around during version upgrades.
R2639. As a user, I'd like to refer to documentation while migrating to 1.3 release.
R2640. If an exception occurs during the deployment of a module within the ModuleRedeployer.redeployModule, the exception will cause the process to break out of the for loops in DepartingContainerModuleRedeployer and ContainerMatchingModuleRedeployer leaving other failed/undeployed modules still undeployed.  This is particularly bad for ContainerMatchingModuleRedeployer as a module with an issue deploying will be retried next time a container starts breaking all modules after it.
R2641. Currently Admin & Container only support latest, 1.0.x and 1.1.0 while singlenode only has tags for 1.0.x and latest.    We need to have a tags for 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.2.1 for all XD Docker images.  
R2642. h2.  Narrarive As a developer, I need to be able to test modules without pushing them to a remote maven repository.  I should be able to do {{$ mvn install}} in my module project locally (which will install the artifact into my local repository) and have it resolvable by spring-cloud-streams.
R2643. Once security is enabled, one cannot upload modules using the shell any longer.
R2644. As a s-c-s user, I'd like to have the option to direct bind _modules_, so I don't have to use messaging middleware and I can eliminate latency between them. This is important for high throughput and low latency use cases.     
R2645. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to establish the foundation to expose REST-APIs to interact with the {{xd-admin}} and likewise perform CRUD operations to maneuver streaming and batch pipelines. 
R2646. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to create {[ModuleRegistry}} stubs, so I can create mock streams by interacting with the registry APIs.
R2647. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to move {{spring-cloud-stream-modules}} from s-c-s to s-c repo, so I can cleanup s-c-s project and at the same time make these modules visible outside of s-c-s.
R2648. As a spring-cloud-data developer, I'd like to use an in-memory stream definition repository, so I don't have to spin up a store; obviously, this will not persist between application executions, but it will be useful for a simplified development experience.  
R2649. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to invoke REST APIs via shell, so I can validate {{StreamController}} operations.
R2650. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to adapt redis {{counter}} from XD to s-c-s, so I can build streaming pipes using s-c-s modules with simple counters to feed dashboards. 
R2651. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to setup CI infrastructure for [s-c-d repo|https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-data], so I can build the project continuously on every commits. 
R2652. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to investigate the right approach to include external library as dependency (ex: MySQL), so I can decide better handling of libraries, which needs loaded and available in root CP at the runtime. 
R2653. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to _bootify_ {{ModuleLauncher}}, so I can use Spring Boot's support for property, setting, as well as adding options and new functionality in the future, such as CP augmentation.  
R2654. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to investigate the right approach to port {{PHD}} as the provider to support {{HDFS}} module from XD, so I can decide better handling of HDFS dependencies, which needs loaded and available in root CP at the runtime. 
R2655. As a s-c-d user, I'd like to add REST support for stream commands, so I can maneuver streaming pipeline backed by StreamController.
R2656. Post 1.2 upgrade, the custom modules no longer show up by just copying the jars to the {{xd.customModule.home}} directory. Instead I have to use the 'module upload' command to install the modules. This is because an MD5 file is required. More details in [SO thread|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31792220/spring-xd-1-2-0-custom-module-deployment]. 
R2657. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to setup CI infrastructure for {{spring-cloud-stream-modules}} (s-c-s-m) repo, so I can build the project continuously on every commits.  
R2658. A test for a java spark module managed by maven, with parent *spring-xd-module-parent* launch a _*java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError*_.

R2659. ModuleDefinition contains bindings that need to be passed to the ModuleRunner app. It appears these can be included in the application's environment.
R2660. A ModuleDefinition contains parameters, which need to be passed to the CloudFoundry application. Currently these are put directly into the application's environment. This issue will verify they are correctly named.
R2661. Test Converter, Configuration, Definition and Status objects.
R2662. Remove all stubs and check all required information is returned accurately.
R2663. Currently there is no ModuleInstanceStatus returned. This issue will fill in the details.
R2664. Currently undeploy is a no-op.
R2665. The current ModuleRunner is test app used for validation. This should be replaced by a real app.
R2666. As part of moving to a bespoke RestOperations application we will need credentials to access CloudFoundry. These will need to be supplied from the new XD Admin app at runtime.
R2667. This class should not know what the test app is. This means changing the constructors on CloudFoundryApplication.
R2668. The current implementation makes use of cf-java-client, which is relatively heavy for our needs. It should be removed in favour of a bespoke RestOperations wrapper. See https://github.com/Zteve/test-cc-oauth for sample code.
R2669. If the value is not set, the source may start before being bound to the bus, throwing a "Dispatcher has no subscribers" error
R2670. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to investigate how to include/exclude msg bus/binding jars, so I can decide the binding selection and fallback mechanism when there is none setup.
R2671. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to add as many jars via a bom (e.g. hadoop distro deps), so I don't have to explicitly worry about individual but related libraries. 
R2672. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to add support for dependency resolution, so when two or more modules use different version of jars (ex: direct binding of two modules that include different versions of spring data), I have the capability to resolve and include the right bits at runtime.
R2673. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to publish the s-c-d image to DockerHub, so I can incrementally push the latest commits to the remote location.
R2674. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to create a public screencast of {{firehose| counter}} pipe, so I can demonstrate s-c-s and the development experience.
R2675. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to implement _undeploy_ operation for {{singlenode}} (single JVM), so I can use this target to undeploy a running stream. More details in [this PR|https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-data/pull/19].    *Note:* Its a prerequisite to determine consistent _undeploy_ strategy for both {{jobs}} and {{streams}}. 
R2676. Running Spring-XD in singlenode using Pivotal HD 2.1 as the Hadoop Distribution.   xd-singlenode --hadoopDistro phd21  I was testing  jdbchdfs job definitions. I am seeing this error that the job exists when in reality, there is no job with that jobName.   xd:>job create testEmployeeJobAgain1 --definition "jdbchdfs --sql='select employee_id, employee_name, employer from EMPLOYEE' --url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/orcl --driverClassName=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver  --username=springxd --password=xdpwd --testOnBorrow=false --directory=/usr/swatest1"  Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Batch Job with the name testEmployeeJobAgain1 already exists  xd:>job list   Job Name  Job Definition  Status   --------  --------------  ------
R2677. As a XD user, I'm trying to access URI (- GET /jobs/executions//steps//progress => hasRole('ROLE_VIEW')), but it fails with 403 forbidden error for the role with view access. More details [here|https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/VESC-475].    Another URL with the same error: http://<HOST>:9393/streams/definitions.json?page=0&size=10
R2678. Apply the same strategy for the Module Command Tests also to all other Shell integration tests.
R2679. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to add support for _profiles_ to the core {{Admin}} application, so I can back the stream repository with respective backend strategy. For example: {{local}} profile would use in-memory strategy to store the metadata.
R2680. As an s-c-s developer, I'd like to brainstorm and design the foundation to port XD modules as s-c-s modules, so I can use it as the base and start migrating the modules.
R2681. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to add support to expose counter (metrics) endpoints, so I can consume to feed the dashboards to demonstrate {{firehose | counter}} pipe.
R2682. Create Confguration and ConfigurationProperties. Configuration must support replacing the default Kryo Codec implementation with something else.
R2683. As a user I would like to have shell interface to the spring-cloud-data rest API. The scope for this JIRA could be limited to stream commands.
R2684. This could focus only on the subset (Stream operations)
R2685. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to collaborate with Boot engineering team and derive a strategy for module metadata via {{@ConfigurationProperties}}, so I can implement the functionality to support {{shell}}, {{autocompletion}}, {{flo}}, and {{ascii}} documentation in _spring-cloud-data_.     Eric's [gap analysis|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A-9RpgSNL6SXD61q9eW2YRkrkn3tXk09rdkx7eCKlxY/edit#] document captures all the specifics in detail. 
R2686. As a Spring XD user, I'm trying to use a custom MongoDB Batch job; however, I'm getting an error running it against 1.2.0/1.2.1 release, while the same works with older releases of Spring XD. More details in this [SO thread|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31838720/mongodb-batch-job-broken-in-spring-xd-1-2-0].  
R2687. When deploying a job through admin UI with a count of 0 the module is actually deployed with count 1.    More info here: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31858631/how-to-define-named-channel-consumer-module-deployment-properties]
R2688. User can configure spring cloud data via  via Spring Cloud Config, data-admin.yml or Spring Cloud Connector * Add bootstrap.yml to spring cloud data * create a default data-admin.yml and configure spring data to look for this vs application.yml. * Spring Cloud Data will have Spring Cloud Config enabled by default ** User has the ability to disable it via the bootstrap.yml
R2689. Enable spring cloud config for all modules  * Add spring cloud config client to pom dependencies.  * Add bootstrap.yml to scs project 
R2690. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to port {{http}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{source}} module in streaming pipeline.  
R2691. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to port {{tcp}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{source}} module to build streaming pipeline.  
R2692. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to move {{twitterstream}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as source modules to build streaming pipeline.  
R2693. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to move {{twittersearch}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as source modules to build streaming pipeline.  
R2694. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to port {{filter}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{processor}} module to build streaming pipeline.
R2695. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to port {{transform}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{processor}} module to build streaming pipeline.
R2696. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to port {{router}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{sink}} module to build streaming pipeline.
R2697. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to port {{file}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{sink}} module to build streaming pipeline.
R2698. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to port {{FTP/SFTP}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{sink}} modules to build streaming pipeline.
R2699. Deploying and launching a Pig job that contains a yarn-site.xml config file fails on the first deploy after XD starts up. This happens consistently.    The error is:     Error: Could not find or load main class org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster    which indicates that the yarn-site.xml file never made it to the classpath.    Un-deploying and re-deploying the job seems to fix the problem.
R2700. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to move {{redis}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{sink}} to build streaming pipeline.
R2701. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to move {{rabbit}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{sink}} to build streaming pipeline.
R2702. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to move {{gemfire}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{sink}} to build streaming pipeline.
R2703. Currently the DSL parsing for tasks is a copy and paste of what it is for streams (minus the ability to parse multiple modules).  This results in a lot of duplication.  This should be refactored to remove duplication and remove explicit references to either streams or tasks in common code.
R2704. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to use the latest releases of {{HDP}}/{{PHD}} distros, so I can leverage the latest features to create pipelines involving {{HDFS}}.
R2705. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to create a section on migration strategy from {{1.2}} to {{1.3}} releases, so I can document new improvements and backward incompatibility specifics.
R2706. Currently, @EnableModule hardcodes references to both the redis and rabbit configuration classes, which trigger or don't trigger based on the presence of another jar (which itself has the meat of the configuration).  This is typically what boot AutoConfiguration is for.    Moreover, adding a new binding (eg Kafka or a stub for module testing) would require to crack open @EnableModule
R2707. As a module author, I want to be able to test my code in "next to real world" conditions (ie Integration Testing, but not really):  - I want all my module wiring to be testable  - I want all my module configuration (@ConfigurationProperties) to be in effect, and I want to be able to test various combination of props  - I want to be able to send data to my module and assert what is coming at the other end  - I want an idiomatic way of asserting the above (eg integration with Hamcrest, etc)  - I DONT want to have to send data to an actual bus (redis, rabbit, etc)
R2708. The `@ConfigurationProperties` class for Rabbit binder has some props related to RetryTemplate, but those are not used
R2709. As an s-c-d developer, I'd like to investigate the distributed deployment of s-c-s modules on YARN, so I can experiment the implementation of YARN SPI and derive the strategy for {{YARNModuleDeployer}}.
R2710. Building and then running spring-cloud-data-rest app on Ubuntu fails when trying to create the first stream.

R2711. I am parsing Json(source)  into CSV  in Transform function All of my Json records may not have all the fields. Some records have only Field1,field2.. some other records have all 3 fields. if the specific field is not exists in specific record, that record got rejected.(by saying field is not exist) Could you please let me know how to check the field exists or not. Here my expression part of the stream transform --expression=#jsonPath(payload,'$.field1').concat('|').concat(#jsonPath(payload,'$.field2')).concat('|').concat(#jsonPath(payload,'$.field3'))  My Spring XD version is  1-0-0-m7
R2712. Hi,  Passwords are visibly when using custom modules.    Attached is example custom module code and xd-shell script to reproduce the problem using stream module of type processor on Spring XD 1.2.1.RELEASE.     Compile with Maven (mvn clean install) and run xd-shell script (xd-shell --cmdfile ./runme.cmd).  
R2713. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to move {{trigger}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as source to build streaming pipeline.  
R2714. As a Spring XD user, I'd like to use redis/sentinel cluster as the 'message bus', so I could create streams and batch pipelines.
R2715. Accessing REST endpoint using the ".json" file extension causes maintenance issues for the authorization rules and is not necessary. Remove any usage for the Admin UI and the Shell.   At the same time the ".json" endpoint shall be deprecated or removed ultimately.
R2716. See discussion at https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-data/pull/37#discussion_r36849117  Also relevant: http://docs.spring.io/spring-hateoas/docs/current/reference/html/#client
R2717. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to upgrade {{receptor-client}} to comply with latest {{Receptor}} API changes, so I can sync-up and take advantage of the recent improvements. 
R2718. Spring Integration 4.2 changed the default SFTP session factory to *not* accept keys from unknown hosts by default. This is more secure.  You either have to provide a pre-populated {{known_hosts}} file or set {{allowUnknownKeys}} to true.  If you do both, the keys will be automatically added to the known hosts file.  When updating XD to 4.2.0.RC1 I simply set the boolean to true, to retain the previous behavior.  Add properties to the SFTP source to allow configuration of these properties at the stream level. 
R2719. Improve Spring Cloud Stream module launcher/resolver properties:  1) Support comma separated remoteRepositories 2) Classify/group the properties
R2720. Spring-cloud-data admin requires lattice connector and `spring-cloud-spring-service-connector` dependencies so that the admin controllers get access to any services while running on lattice.  One example is, CounterContoller using `redis` service for MetricRepository.
R2721. As a user I should be able to use the existing admin UI client for spring-cloud-data admin with the appropriate server configurations.
R2722. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to create auto configuration for {{singlenode}} binder configuration/properties, so I can automatically configure the Spring application based on the dependencies.
R2723. Build SCS and SCD projects upon change in github repo. Push docker image for SCD-Admin to docker hub
R2724. As a s-c-d user, I'd like to have the option to support passing definition parameters into YARN container, so I can effectively use those _params_ within the module running inside the container.
R2725. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to add support to deploy YARN App into HDFS automatically, so I can have the {{xd-admin}} orchestrate overall deployment by leveraging the manifest to deploy where and with what assets.
R2726. As an s-c-d developer, I'd like to add support to negotiate with the ResourceManager REST-APIs to deploy modules by groups. so I can build instrumentation to start the App instances automatically. Perhaps also take into account of the App specifics such as  {{appType=CLOUDDATA}} and {{appName=spring-cloud-data-yarn-app}}. 
R2727. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to support multiple app instances:  * This is simply to make controlling app instances more clever. Potentially we could use deployment properties to define different yarn app instances like:    {code}  cloud-data:>stream deploy --name ticktock --properties "module.*.yarn.app.name=app"     cloud-data:>stream deploy --name ticktock --properties "module.time.yarn.app.name=app"  {code}    * Motivation to this is that different yarn apps can have different queues and priorities. Yarn administrator can define that some app queues have higher priority to reserve resources from    * Using deployment properties like this allows to customize runtime parameters like how much we try to reserve mem/cpu for modules, etc.
R2728. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to make the deployer work asynchronously, so I can use the shell to return quickly and also queue deploy operations within YARN as tasks.
R2729. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to experiment how do we resolve and then add module dependent JAR's to Boot loader, so I have an approach to handle external libraries required by OOTB modules. 
R2730. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to refactor the current {{ModuleLauncher}} contract with Boot's {{JarLauncher}} API, so we don't have to maintain duplicate functionality.
R2731. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to complete documentation and test-cases on resolving and adding JAR's to Boot loader, so we could use this as a reference while porting modules with external dependencies. 
R2732. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to add support to add external libraries, so I can consume such dependencies for modules in an uniform way.
R2733. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to enforce external libraries from overriding any existing library in the uber-jar.
R2734. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to move the external library to its own project, so we have a clear separation of functionalities in s-c-d repo.
R2735. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to port SFTP module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as source modules to build streaming pipeline. 
R2736. h2. Narrative As Spring XD, I will be able to launch Spring Boot jar files as Diego Tasks.  h2. Back story The {{TaskLauncher}} will be responsible for listening for launch requests, looking up the definition in the {{TaskDescriptorRepository}}, and launching it.  The first implementation of this would be a Receptor based implementation.   *See:* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q964adRCA-kJke_i0GBToJHLXJJTV_7TaTpQT0ymsbc/edit
R2737. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to create a new project to contain all the rules associated {{@RedisRule}} contract, so it is isolated from core functionalities and reusable by test coverage as needed.      Consider moving this coverage to SI "commons" or equivalent. 
R2738. Ultimately module IntegrationTest classes should themselves be a module so that testing a Source for example would use a TestSink and the message verified on the sink input().  This is currently a placeholder which includes: * SCS enhancements to support proxying of Pollable or Subscribable MessgeChannels * Corresponding Changes to the s-c-s-test-support to eliminate MessageCollector and provide support for easily using the test's PollableChannel(s) if necessary, e.g. test-specific annotations * Related to or may depend on implementing direct binding (composed modules) in s-c-s  * Refactor existing module test code
R2739. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to create foundation to support _processor_ as OOTB modules, so I can use the processor modules from {{s-c-s-m}} repo to build streaming pipeline.
R2740. Make ChannelBindingAdapter implement SmartLifecycle so that it gets started with the highest precedence and before any other message producing bean.
R2741. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to enable {{offline}} mode for {{AetherModuleResolver}}, so I can pull the module artifacts from local instead of remote maven repo.
R2742. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to create {{ModuleRegistry}} implementation, so I can use this infrastructure to lookup module coordinates by name.
R2743. Can take from previous implementation in XD/SI/Boot.  Should have a way to enforce not skipping tests based on an environment variable.    Consider moving this coverage to SI "commons" or equivalent. 
R2744. h2. Narrative As a user, I need to be able to deploy a task (boot jar) via the CLI.  h2.  Back story Since the concept of jobs as an explicit primitive within Spring XD is going away in spring-cloud-data, the shell needs to be updated to reflect that.
R2745. This JIRA addresses couple of issues: 1) When the modules are deployed into cloud environment there is an issue where local configuration beans collide with cloud service beans. We witnessed an issue where there are two `RedisConnectionFactory` beans registered in the same application context. We need to have a control the way in which the auto configuration gets invoked and service beans are created. 2) We need to align the cloud connector dependencies into a common place so that we don't have to specify them at various places like (SCS, SCS-Binder, SCS-modules) etc., It is a good idea to have these dependencies specified in SCS-modules so that it get used subsequently by SCS when the module is assembled at runtime.
R2746. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to have {{module info}}, {{module list}}, {{module register}}, and {{module unregister}} commands, so I can interact with {{ModuleRegistry}}.
R2747. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to have {{module info}} shell command, so I can query each of the module specifics such as description and support options. 
R2748. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to have {{module list}} shell command, so I can query and list all the modules supported within the {{ModuleRegistry}}.
R2749. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to have {{module register}} shell command, so I can register new modules in the {{ModuleRegistry}}.
R2750. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to have {{module unregister}} shell command, so I can unregister an existing module from the {{ModuleRegistry}}.
R2751. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to provide optional key-value pairs as deployment properties, so I could leverage them at the runtime to instruct how the modules will be deployed.   _The scope of this story is to specifically support {{count}} to represent {{N}} instances of modules that share the same environment variables._
R2752. Instead of using real `moduleDeployer`, try using mocks so that the module deployer downloading the maven co-ordinates from repo can be avoided (for module deployment case).  Since module deployer and controllers are tested individually, it would be good to focus on shell functionality only for the shell tests.
R2753. The s-c-s-module-launcher document requires update for running it on standalone, docker, lattice. Also, the docker-compose yml requires fix so that modules in there are bound together.
R2754. The Chrome UI Interface for flo stream creation stops responding after some time. It starts working once the browser history/ cookies etc. are cleaned up.   . The drop down stops working,   . i'm unable to look at or edit module properties,  . connecting different modules doesn't work either . Drag and drop operations still work . command line stream creation still works  is anyone else facing these issues ?   Thanks ! 
R2755. In JOBS tab; Quick-filter search box paging functionality is not working as expected. Items stay in the page they were first loaded after filtering.   ex. If there were 500 pages of jobs and you are filtering for a job which was in 345. page, after the filtering you have to navigate to that page in order to see the job. It needs to be rendered on the first page.     
R2756. If there is a large number of deployments it would be helpful to have a quick search filter in place to enable users to find deployments faster, as can be done in the Definitions page.
R2757. Create a timestamp job that will be used a a sample for users to create their own spring boot based jobs.    
R2758. The state of a task or job should be recorded such that it can be monitored by a user.  
R2759. SCD Admin will have connection information for a task and job repository.  This information will need to be transferred to the Task Launcher.    The scope is to study the following options:  * Would the default place for configurations be in the YAML file?  * {{config-server}} should be an option?  * If nothing specified, the default is always YAML?
R2760. Need infrastructure to capture the state from the environment (lattice, local) running the task.    Task Launcher needs ability to map the task state as it is reported from the cloud environment (lattice, local) to the enumerated state as specified [#here|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tTmQMIwSUEFewYYsafK8Ji4Z9NI-5F1VFeAiWHuZSgg/edit#heading=h.2ec94f2he9ly].    The state information needs to be recorded in the task_execution table enumerated [#here|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tTmQMIwSUEFewYYsafK8Ji4Z9NI-5F1VFeAiWHuZSgg/edit#heading=h.2ec94f2he9ly].

R2764. As a s-c-s developer, I'd like to fix the {{Kafka}} binder, so I can create messaging microservices apps and successfully bind them to an operational Kafka broker. 
R2765. Deploying a Stream with HDFS sink and JDBC as source displays incorrect information on the tooltip for the JDBC source. The issue occurs when there are more than 1 containers deployed and the source is deployed on one container and the sink is deployed on another container. I have checked the REST endpoints and they seem to show the correct information. (http://localhost:9393/runtime/containers.json)    In my test case, say if there are 2 containers and source and sink are deployed on the same container, the tooltip's show correct information. The Stream I used for testing purposes is as follows -  {noformat}   stream create swagataTestIssue --definition "jdbc --query='select employee_id, employee_name, employer from EMPLOYEE' --url='jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/orcl'  --username=springxd --password=xdpwd --driverClassName=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver --testOnBorrow=false | hdfs --inputType=application/json " --deploy   {noformat}    I will attach the screenshots. This issue has also been reported when using Gemfire as source and HDFS as sink.    Thanks,  Swagata
R2766. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to produce ref. documentation for s-c-d architecture, so I could define 1.x and 2.x deployment differences. 
R2767. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to study [Concourse CI|http://concourse.ci/] so I can understand how to use it for s-c-d going forward. 
R2768. h2. Narrative  As a user I need to be able to query the current state of a task that has been launched.    h2. Back story  Given the fact that tasks are intended to go away, we need to record the state of them as well as their end result in a repository for a user to be able to query.  This repository will be the system of record when reporting the state of an executing/executed task.
R2769. Currently we deploy a single instance, and ignore the ModuleDeploymentRequest instances setting.    It is easy to change this in the ModuleDeployer, but there is no guarantee this will work in the ModuleLauncher, so we hold off until that can be verified.
R2770. Currently only the STARTED application (and application instance) status is recognised. This issue will look at the other possible states and report them as module instance states.    This would be trivial if we knew what the possible states might be and how we should interpret them for module instance state.
R2771. Currently we handle only a single page response from CC SPI list requests, but potentially there could be multiple ones.
R2772. Upload of module launcher bits is slow because we do not take into account the  CC cache. To fix this we need to use an async upload, and to somehow generate  the SHA, etc, for the Module Launcher so that CC can pre-empt uploading all  the bits every time.
R2773. As a module author, I would like to apply RxJava processor module with spring cloud stream. 
R2774. Create Parent pom file for build  Create .settings file  Migrate Timestamp task from SCSM to SCTM.  
R2775. If the module launcher's module arg is delimited by underscore (--args_0_fixedDelay=1), then boot ignores that property. It is important to support the underscore delimited property arguments as we set environment properties of these in CF and lattice environment.    The spring boot fix (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/5a287455273270a20742f03e4546acde9e857bee) doesn't resolve the property if the value type of the Map is Map itself.
R2776. We currently use fixed paths like `spring-cloud-data-yarn/spring-cloud-data-yarn-appmaster/target/spring-cloud-data-yarn-appmaster-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar` in yml files. Need to make define version during a build and allow to override location of those files.
R2777. As a s-c-d user, I'd like to create a new banner, so I can embed and display the banner when the shell server boots-up.     Perhaps use this [banner generator|http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Standard&t=Spring%20Cloud%0AData%20Flow%20%20%3E%3E%3E%3E%3E%20]?
R2778. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to document [Running on Cloud Foundry|https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow#running-on-cloud-foundry] section in README, so it can be publicly available as deployment guideline.
R2779. (From Eric)  Deploying using the following stream fails (probably because of issues around quoting):  `stream create foo --definition "time | filter --expression=payload.contains('0') | log" --deploy`  When you try to destroy the stream the destroy fails, which shouldn't happen whether the stream was valid or not.
R2780. When the {{BroadcasterMessageHandler}} is defined as a {{@ServiceActivator}} {{@Bean}} , the output channel must be set on the handler, not in the annotation.    The handler should detect a {{null}} {{outputChannel}}.    See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32462059/spring-xd-reactor-streams-with-configuration-npe

R2784. The new SCSM twitterstream module uses a different format than XD 1.x source module. It should match what Twitter uses so existing processors etc. will continue to work.
R2785. What is the functional justification for enforcing this validation on modules? Is it really necessary to enforce that the short description must start with a capitol letter and end with a period? Seems a bit unnecessary and opinionated to me.    Caused by: org.springframework.validation.BindException: org.springframework.validation.BeanPropertyBindingResult: 1 errors  Field error in object 'info' on field 'shortDescription': rejected value [...snip...]; codes [Pattern.info.shortDescription,Pattern.shortDescription,Pattern.java.lang.String,Pattern]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [info.shortDescription,shortDescription]; arguments []; default message [shortDescription],[Ljavax.validation.constraints.Pattern$Flag;@3984374e,^\p{IsUppercase}.*\.$]; default message [Short description must start with a capital letter and end with a dot]  
R2786. The CF implementation requires that a route be created for each new app. This works fine on the happy path, but is brittle. For example, it will fail if the route required already exists.

R2788. When opening manager webapp, if the internet connection is slow enough to make one of the biggest javascript dependencies to make requirejs throw a timeout the webapp becomes unusable, displaying only the loading gif, and showing a javascript error saying:    Uncaught Error: Load timeout for modules: angular    It typically takes ~ 10 seconds to throw that error.
R2789. When composing two or more modules together, if any output or input type is specified between modules, it is ignored.     I created a stream with definition:  {code}  mySourceModule --outputType=application/json | myProcessorModule  {code}  that worked fine as expected. When i composed this definition as a composed module, I got errors stating that the processors message handler had no handler method for the object the source module emitted. The process was only configured to accept JSON as string. I simply had to create a second handler method but if i didnt own the module, this could be an issue.
R2790. Created a stream with definition:  {code}  mySourceModule | myProcessorModule | log  {code}  This stream worked fine, but when created composed module with definition  {code}  mySourceModule | myProcessorModule  {code}  Then stream definition  {code}  myComposedModule | log  {code}    get an error stating that the output channel of mySourceModule has no subscribers. Looking at previous bugs, this appears to be a module binding order in which the source is started before the processor has subscribed to the output channel of the source.
R2791. It would be extremely nice to have the various property sources available in the Spring Environment bean for a module to use.
R2792. As a XD developer, I'd like to explore repository options for "composed jobs", so I have the leverage to read/write composed job definitions.

R2858. The spark app test on spark standalone cluster is currently commented out:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/9307f1fba347adf59c8b489ae7fe0aa9bfd9b6a6/spring-xd-integration-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/xd/integration/test/SparkAppTests.java#L74    We need to add it back once the cluster is setup on acceptance test environment.
R2859. For example the generated value for the cassandra sink results in     {{-$$entityBasePackages$$:: $$the base packages to scan for entities annotated with Table annotations$$ ($$String;$$, default: `[Ljava.lang.String;@2638011`)}}    where the default value changes each time the build is run.  
R2860. As an XD developer, I'd like to explore options to remove composed job, so I can clean-up unused resources and memory footprints. 
R2861. As an XD developer, I'd like to explore options to save composed job definition in ZK metadata, so I can use the repository to recreate jobs to recover from failure scenarios.
R2862. h2. Narrative  As the system, I would like a way to launch a previously deployed job module from another job module.    h2.  Back story  For the composed job story, we will have a driver job that consists of each step that represents the execution of a job.  This story is the creation of a {{Tasklet}} that will launch the child job, and upon it's completion, set the results of the driver's step to that of the slave job's results.  
R2863. h2. Narrative  As the xd user, I would like a way obtain the result of each child job as it is represented as a step in the parent job's graph.    h2.  Back story  Each child job will have a completion status of its own that will be displayed in the Spring XD UI as well as the shell's job execution list.   
R2864. h2. Narrative  Verify that the job launch works as we expect for the composed job.  
R2865. h2. Narrative  As a XD user, I'd like to restart the composed job workflow from Shell/UI. 
R2866. When a default value is an array, the current behavior (using toString()) not only produces useless results (like `[Ljava.lang.String;@2638011`) but also constantly changing results.
R2867. We have a use case where we need the HTTP source module to return a 204 status instead of the 200 status that is currently returned. There may be other status codes that it would be useful to be able to return. A simple additional option on the module would allow this to be configured.  
R2868. As a developer, I want to have a {{BinderFactory}} abstraction, so that I can support multiple binder types in the future.
R2869. As a developer, I want to be able to connect to multiple types of transports in an application, so that I can receive and send messages to different transport types.
R2870. As a developer, I want to be able to connect to multiple external systems for the same binding type, so that I can read data from a system and write it to another.
R2871. XD Developer does not want the the twitter stream acceptance tests to interfere with other tests.
R2872. Several issues with 1.3.0.M1 staged version    - we now use Tomcat instead of Jetty which prevent s xd-admin from starting on YARN    - we now have Guava 18.0 on classpath instead of 16.0.1    - xd-yarn push doesn't work, hadoop client for 2.7.1 needs Servlet API     - updating Hadoop to 2.7.1 instead of 2.6.0    -- this causes Curator to also update to 2.7.1 which throws exception on startup

R2874. As an XD module developer I would like to use HDFS for my custom module location even when my namenode is configured for HA.     We had an issue filed in the `spring-xd-ambari` project:    "It seems like custom module doesn't pickup namenode HA? and still use NameNodeProxies.createNonHAProxy?"    see: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-ambari/issues/14
R2875. In https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/blob/master/README.md#running-on-cloud-foundry the section starting 'Now we can configure the app' needs to be revised - the information is both out of date and, even if up-to-date, misleading (it includes some values as if they are universal, when they are really just examples).
R2876. As a Spring XD developer, I'd like to move {{cassandra}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{sink}} to build streaming pipeline.

R2888. As an s-c-d user, I'd like to deploy s-c-d on Mesos.
R2889. When the following format is specified  -  {noformat}   home: file://hadoop/xd/custom-modules  {noformat}  There is no root-path ('/') following the 'file://' scheme. That makes the Hadoop job launcher interpret what follows as a host name and will look for '/xd/custom-modules' on the host 'hadoop'. This results in "java.net.UnknownHostException: hadoop".    This format works for module upload though. The module upload relies on resource location resolution from Spring Framework which is more lenient [1]. The MapReduce job submission uses code from the Apache Hadoop project and uses a more stringent resolution.     This results in ambiguity 'file://my/directory' and requires the root path to be specified.

R2893. h2. Narrative  As an XD developer, I need to be able to create a composed job module as XML from the DSL an store it in the Module File repository.   While the user uses the composed job as if it is a normal job including seeing only the DSL.  In the background the JobFactory will deploy the composed job module.    * When the user destroys the job the module will be deleted from the file module repository.  * When the user creates the job a module will be created in the file Module repository.  h2. Back story  For the composed job story, we need to create a "real" job module to be expressed in XML, so that we can take advantage of the job execution tasklet in XD-3556, so that each job can be executed as a step in the composed job.
R2894. As a XD developer, I'd like to reproduce and fix anomalies as listed [here|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-admin-ui-client/issues/9].
R2895. As an s-c-d user, I'm trying to access {{admin}} REST endpoints running on CF but I'm getting SSL authentication errors.  
R2896. As an s-c-d user, I'd like to take advantage of admin running on variety of platforms such as Lattice, YARN or CF. I'd like to access REST APIs consistently across these platforms.
R2897. As a SCDF user, I want to be able to register artifacts as libraries, so that I can reference them in include and exclude statements.
R2898. As an s-c-d user, I'd like to have the option to use _named channels_, so I can create streaming pipelines without source or sink modules. 
R2899. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to add test coverage for {{StreamController}}, so I can verify API contracts at build time. 
R2900. As a s-c-d user, I should be prevented from creating streams with duplicate name. I'd expect streams to have unique names all the time. 
R2901. Described in https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/issues/144    As a developer, I want Input enpoints to be started after all the beans in the context, so that received messages can be delivered to components.

R2904. As a s-c-s user, I'd like to use {{kinesis}} module, so I can use it as {{sink}} module to build streaming pipeline.
R2905. We need to make sure that JMX MBean names are unique, even in the case of labeled modules.    The following stream fails for example: "http | filter | filter2: filter | log"    A good candidate could be stream name (group) + module label.
R2906. As a developer, I'd like to port {{Log}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{sink}} modules to build streaming pipeline.
R2907. In my test case, I have security enabled. I tested this on distributed mode. I have a few Streams deployed.  * Started 3 XD containers.   * Issue *Shutdown* from UI  * The containers don't show up on the UI any more  * jps lists the process id of 2 ContainerServerApplication(there should be none listed)    I have noticed different test results every time, like at times 2 out of 3 containers are terminated and at times 1 out of 3 are terminated.

R2911. As a developer, I'd like to port {{rich-gauge}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{sink}} module to build streaming pipeline.
R2912. As a data scientist, I'd like to have the option to process data using {{flink}} processor, so I can take advantage of the streaming machine learning abstractions implemented on top of Flink. 
R2913. The Kafka sink should not make use of the message headers sent by the Kafka receivers in the Kafka bus.     Similarly, the headers received from the Kafka source should not be propagated when sending to the Kakfa bus.     https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/1804
R2914. Hey Guys,    I have been using the sqoopTasklet for a while but I found an unexpected problem.

Available:[TOKEN, KERBEROS    So it means the sqooptasklet isn't setting the kerberos authentication, this basically because in the SqoopTasklet class is adding some prefix to the configurations (SPRING_HADOOP_CONFIG_PREFIX)    https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/extensions/spring-xd-extension-sqoop/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/sqoop/SqoopTasklet.java    Really doesn't make sense for me add those prefix and remove it later in the next call in the SqoopRunner class.     https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/blob/master/extensions/spring-xd-extension-sqoop/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/sqoop/SqoopRunner.java    If I inject  the security.* configurations directly to the list arguments it works.     I'm sure you guys have a good reason to add the prefix  but I don't see why. Unfortunately is  annoying when you are developing in a local VM where you can test the  simple authentication and after move the job to dev/prod environments with kerberos auth, the above because you must change your sqooptasklet configuration injecting the new parameters. If the SqoopTasklet allows inject those parameters directly from the hadoop.properties file you don't need change tasklet  configurations to run your jobs with different authentication methods.     Thanks in advance.   Héctor
R2915. I have a distributed XD Cluster with one admin and two containers using Redis as the message bus. In certain cases I want to use direct binding to remove communication with the message bus and deploy all modules to all containers with the aim of improving performance. I’ve found that even when using direct binding, XD still communicates with Redis when it shouldn’t need to. This could have an impact on performance.    This is easily reproducible in our 2 container cluster as follows:    Use the redis-cli monitor command to monitor Redis.    Create and deploy a simple stream with direct binding:    {code}  stream create --definition "http | log" --name httpLog  stream deploy --name httpLog --properties "module.*.count=0"  {code}    As expected both modules get deployed to both nodes. Testing shows messages sent to the http endpoint of one container always come out in the log for that container implying direct binding is in play as expected.    However once the streams are deployed the Redis monitor starts showing a Redis queue being accessed from both XD conatiners:    {code}  1444731527.086325 [0 10.0.1.8:57454] "brpop" "queue.httpLog.0" "1"  1444731528.086304 [0 10.0.1.4:37337] "brpop" "queue.httpLog.0" "1"  1444731529.086341 [0 10.0.1.8:57454] "brpop" "queue.httpLog.0" "1"  1444731530.086317 [0 10.0.1.4:37337] "brpop" "queue.httpLog.0" "1"  1444731531.086340 [0 10.0.1.8:57454] "brpop" "queue.httpLog.0" "1"  1444731532.086505 [0 10.0.1.4:37337] "brpop" "queue.httpLog.0" "1"  {code}    This shouldn’t need to happen in direct binding. These messages stop once the stream is undeployed.  
R2916. If I deploy more than one instance of a module (eg using module.name.count > 1 or module.name.count =0) that consumes from a tap or topic then I get duplicate messages if I’m using Redis as the message bus. It looks like this is the same issue as XD-3100 but the fix for that only fixed Rabbit as the message bus.    This is easy to reproduce on a 2 container cluster using a Redis Message Bus:    Create and deploy streams as follows:    {code}  stream create --definition "http | log" --name httpLog  stream deploy --name httpLog --properties "module.*.count=0"  stream create --definition "tap:stream:httpLog > transform --expression='payload.toString() + \" TAPPED\"' | log" --name httpLogTap   stream deploy --name httpLogTap --properties "module.*.count=0"  {code}    On container 1 send a message:    {code}  curl --data "test message 001" http://localhost:9000/httpLog  {code}    Container 1 logs are then:    {code}  2015-10-13 14:16:28.853  INFO 22774 --- [ol-28-thread-18] xd.sink.httpLog                          : test message 001  2015-10-13 14:16:28.855  INFO 22774 --- [enerContainer-4] xd.sink.httpLogTap                       : test message 001 TAPPED  {code}    and container 2:    {code}  2015-10-13 14:16:28.859  INFO 22719 --- [enerContainer-4] xd.sink.httpLogTap                       : test message 001 TAPPED  {code}    Ie the tapped message is duplicated (picked up by both tap module instances)    Similarly for topics create and deploy these streams:    {code}  stream create --definition "http > topic:mytopic" --name httpTopic  stream deploy --name httpTopic --properties "module.*.count=0"  stream create --definition "topic:mytopic > transform --expression='payload.toString() + \" TOPIC CONSUMER 1\"' | log" --name topicConsumer1  stream deploy --name topicConsumer1 --properties "module.*.count=0"  stream create --definition "topic:mytopic > transform --expression='payload.toString() + \" TOPIC CONSUMER 2\"' | log" --name topicConsumer2  stream deploy --name topicConsumer2 --properties "module.*.count=0"  {code}    On container 1 send a message:    {code}  curl --data "test message 002" http://localhost:9000/httpLog  {code}    Container 1 logs are then:    {code}  2015-10-13 14:34:23.168  INFO 22774 --- [enerContainer-2] xd.sink.topicConsumer2                   : test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 2  2015-10-13 14:34:23.172  INFO 22774 --- [enerContainer-2] xd.sink.topicConsumer1                   : test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 1  {code}    and container 2:    {code}  2015-10-13 14:34:23.173  INFO 22719 --- [enerContainer-2] xd.sink.topicConsumer2                   : test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 2  2015-10-13 14:34:23.177  INFO 22719 --- [enerContainer-2] xd.sink.topicConsumer1                   : test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 1  {code}    Ie the topic message is picked up by each instance of the module in each stream.

R2917. Most, if not all, of the deployers have some concept of customization of the deployed modules: be it memory, or cpu, disk, etc.    This ticket is about harmonizing the handling of such properties, with the assumption that we want a per-deployer set of defaults and overridability at deployment time.
R2918. Currently, s-c-s modules all come with baked in support for multiple cloud binding technologies:    {code:xml}  		<!-- Lattice core dependency that activates cloud,lattice profiles when running on Lattice -->  		<dependency>  			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>  			<artifactId>spring-cloud-lattice-core</artifactId>  			<version>${spring-cloud-lattice.version}</version>  			<optional>true</optional>  		</dependency>  		<!-- Cloud connector dependencies -->  		<!-- Lattice connector dependency to create services info from lattice -->  		<dependency>  			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>  			<artifactId>spring-cloud-lattice-connector</artifactId>  			<version>${spring-cloud-lattice.version}</version>  			<optional>true</optional>  		</dependency>  		<!-- CF connector dependency to create services info from CF -->  		<dependency>  			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>  			<artifactId>spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-connector</artifactId>  			<optional>true</optional>  		</dependency>  		<!-- dependency to connect to detected cloud services -->  		<dependency>  			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>  			<artifactId>spring-cloud-spring-service-connector</artifactId>  			<optional>true</optional>  		</dependency>  {code}    Should the deployers add those at runtime instead?
R2919. There is a need to customize the ModuleLauncher behavior (itself, NOT pass options to modules that are launched, which is already supported) for example to set the location of the maven repository.    
R2920. As a s-c-d user, I'd like to have {{runtime info}} as shell command, so I can use this to list the details about the module such as {{host}}, {{port}} and the like.
R2921. As a s-c-d user, I'd like to deploy data flow on YARN, so I can reuse the existing Hadoop cluster and leverage data flow features to build streaming or batch pipelines.
R2922. We are seeing JDBC connection pool errors when running 'jdbchdfs' jobs and 'jdbc' streams. The exception is:    {code}  Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Failed to validate a newly established connection.          at org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.ConnectionPool.borrowConnection(ConnectionPool.java:802)          at org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.ConnectionPool.borrowConnection(ConnectionPool.java:617)          at org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.ConnectionPool.getConnection(ConnectionPool.java:186)          at org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceProxy.getConnection(DataSourceProxy.java:127)          at org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager.doBegin(DataSourceTransactionManager.java:204)          ... 21 more  {code}    A workaround is to specify "--testOnBorrow=false" when creating the job.    This has also been reported on SO (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33148929/springxd-issue-in-mysql-as-source-failed-to-validate-a-newly-established-connec).
R2923. Currently, the Kafka Message Bus does not have the ability to configure a set of custom headers to persist in the `embeddedHeaders` mode (only the message-bus specific) message headers are persisted. 
R2924. As a developer, I'd like to port {{file}} module from XD to s-c-s repo, so I can use it as {{source}} module to build streaming pipeline.
R2925. Hello guys,    I hope you are doing good. I found a problem when I try run long sqoop imports (4 hours or more). For some reason when the sqoop step finish the system is not able to save the meta data for the current sqoop step however the sqoop import finish without problems.    2015-10-17T03:04:03-0400 1.2.0.RELEASE ERROR SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor-4 step.AbstractStep - Encountered an error saving batch meta data for step import-logs in job ingestion-flow. This job is now in an unknown state and should not be restarted.    Please see attached log file for more details.   Could you please let me know if you need other details to find what is the problem?     Thanks in advance  Héctor    
R2926. As a s-c-d developer, I'd like to break the build lifecycle to bundle SPI deployers individually, so I don't have to build {{admin}} with all the deployer variations as one whole thing.
R2927. Move project out of https://github.com/pperalta/geode-scdf into https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream
R2928. Using these as a starting point, support the standard binder partitioning properties:    https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-binders/spring-cloud-stream-binder-spi/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/binder/BinderProperties.java#L69    https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/master/spring-cloud-stream-binders/spring-cloud-stream-binder-spi/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/binder/MessageChannelBinderSupport.java#L663
R2929. As a developer, I'd like to get rid off {{XDRuntimeException}} from XD.
R2930. It seems like springxd_shell will pull jhs principal and keytab from mapred-site.xml. When springxd_shell is installed in edge node, Amabri returns "can't find jhs keytab" and failed.    Details [here|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-ambari/issues/8].
R2931. As a user, I'd like to enable HA on {{namenode}} without having to enable custom configuration.     More details [here|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-ambari/issues/6].
R2932. The comments in [22|https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-modules/pull/22] indicate that we also need to run a gemfire cache server in order for the tests to pass. We should create an embedded cache server since it would be much easier not have to have an XD or gemfire install in order to test the sink.
R2933. As a user, I'd like to use the latest release of {{gemfire}} sink, so I can create a streaming pipeline to land data in gemfire. 
R2934. As a user, I'd like to use SFTP source module, so I can create streaming pipeline with it. However, I cannot see SFTP as OOTB module listed on: {{module list}} and as well as the module bits are not available in [maven repo|http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/stream/module/]. 
R2935. See discussion at https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/issues/159
R2936. As a developer, I'd like to resolve remaining gaps wrt CI pipelines for Data Flow and the family, so I can continuously evaluate functionalities on every commit.
R2937. As a Flo user, I'd like to have {{timeout}} and {{pollInterval}} as global options at the DSL level, so I can override the defaults at will. 
R2938. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to SI 4.2.1 release, so I can take advantage of the latest improvements.
R2939. The {{FieldValueCounterHandler}} handles {{POJO}}, {{Tuple}}, and {{JSON}}.    {{#jsonPath}} emits a {{LinkedHashMap}}.    The handler should natively support a {{Map}}.    See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33270926/springxds-field-value-counter-doesnt-work-after-splitting-json-object-array-in/33281783#33281783
R2940. See https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/issues/128    This is needed to support "channel > channel" type constructs
R2941. Following merge of https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/commit/5cb81c49a240304be14bcf5d724cfd36df403d39, the following changes need to happen at shell/REST level:    {{module list}} should not show libraries  {{library list}} should be added to show libs  {{module register}} should not accept type=library  {{library register}} should be added  {{module info}} should not accept libs  {{library info}} should be added
R2942. As a developer, I'd like to review and refactor {{JobLaunchingTasklet}}, so I can improve performance characteristics. 
R2943. Hey Guys,    We are facing an annoying problem and I can't figure out how solve it.

R2944. Currently it’s possible to do this via   {code}  source | router --expression=''queue:queue1,queue:queue2''  {code}  but this involves an additional hop to the message bus for the pipe between the source and router.    It would be better if this was supported directly with the existing named channel syntax to remove this pipe ie  {code}  source > queue:queue1,queue:queue2  {code}  This would be useful as a possible solution in the scenario described in XD-3613 as an alternative to using topics on the Redis message bus which don’t support having multiple instances of the same consumer.

R2947. This would allow multiple individual sink modules to be combined via the shell DSL so that each message sent to the composite sink module will be sent to each of the individual sink modules in turn.   Internally this would probably use a recipient list router to send to each individual sink.    Module options for each individual sink would be combined to create the overall options for the composite sink module in a similar way to existing composite modules.    This would allow construction of streams with less communication with the message bus for example as an alternative to using a named topic in the message bus.    Using this in conjunction with sinks built using existing composite module functionality (as a combination of processors and a sink) would allow more sophisticated combinations to be constructed and deployed as a single module (with no message bus communication).    One particular application of this would be with tap and counter functionality. If multiple fields in a message need counted this currently needs to be done as separate streams tapping the original with the overhead of the tapped message being read from the message bus multiple times potentially on different nodes, this enhancement would allow all the counters to be combined to make a more cohesive composite counter module so that the tapped message would only need to be read once.  
R2948. We currently support HDP 2.3.0. The most recent HDP version is 2.3.2. This latest HDP release also changes Spark version to 1.4.1.
R2949. As a user, I'd like to use SpEL expressions inline at the stream definition level, so I can operate on the payload consistently while using any OOTB, including the custom modules. 
R2950. As a module developer I would like the JsonStringToTupleConverter in the Spring Cloud Streams project to maintain the types provided in the JSON string and not convert everything to a String representation.
R2951. Both lifecycle and send/receive methods are synchronized, so if the shell command processor is blocked reading from the script's input - e.g. when no proper terminator is sent by the script, the stop() method can't acquire the object lock and proceed stopping the instance, and therefore the module.

R2954. As a developer, I'd like to add {{undeployed}} status for YARN SPI, so I can represent the correct status instead of the current {{unknown}} state.
R2955. I am able to run a Sqoop Job to copy data from oracle to Hadoop and I can relaunch the job manually through shell command or admin UI. But I don't see option to set some number or auto retry option, so that when ever failure happens, system will automatically retry some number of times that we specify.
R2956. org.apache.sqoop.validation.Validator interface doesn't contain any job information and it has only ValidationContext object reference. I am trying to write custom class that implements Validator class and trying to store the source count and destination count into data base.

R2966. As a user, I'd like to see the version and SPI type in the `about` section, so I can confirm which build of {{admin-ui}} I'm currently using. 
R2967. As a user, I'd like Flo Graphs as screenshots while referring to the batch DSL, so it will be easy for me to relate to concepts. 
R2968. As a developer, I'd like to revisit the existing design and identify known limitations and/or the gaps. 
R2969. As a user, I'd like to have direct shell commands to scale up/down a given module instance, so I can avoid SPI specific CLI commands that needs run outside of data flow.
R2970. As a developer, I'd like to submit a PR for existing work on Mesos SPI. 
R2971. As a follow-up from [XD-3613|https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-3629], we would want to fix this experience for Kafka message bus.

R2978. As a developer, I'd like to add support for {{undeployed}} status consistently across all the deployers, so I can present the correct status instead of the current {{unknown}}. This is applicable for existing streams without any deployment context associated with it. 
R2979. As a developer, I'd like to add {{undeployed}} status for k8s SPI, so I can represent the correct status instead of the current {{unknown}} state.

R2985. Need to add the following instructions to setup the configurations for the Batch Repo to Composed Job Docs to support parallel jobs:  1) uncomment and change the following from  :  ```spring:    batch:  # Configure other Spring Batch repository values.  Most are typically not needed      isolationLevel: ISOLATION_SERIALIZATION  ```  to  ```spring:    batch:  # Configure other Spring Batch repository values.  Most are typically not needed      isolationLevel: ISOLATION_READ_COMMITTED  ```    And update the hsqldb datasource to:  spring:    datasource:      url: jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://${hsql.server.host:localhost}:${hsql.server.port:9101}/${hsql.server.dbname:xdjob};sql.enforce_strict_size=true;hsqldb.tx=mvcc
R2986. As a developer, I'd like to be able to clean Rabbit binder broker artifacts using the REST API.    When the Rabbit Bus was ported from XD, the bus cleaner was ported as {{RabbitBindingCleaner}} but the REST API to invoke it was not ported over.
R2987. Users want the ability to use Composed Jobs (specifically parallel Jobs) without having to update the configurations for the hsqldb and the Isolation Level for spring batch.  These should be set by default.  
R2988. Make it more clear what drivers need to be copied where. See - https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/1653
R2989. If using the definition <aaa || bbb> where the definition starts with a "<" and ends with a ">" the definition for the composed job does not appear on the definition page.
R2990. As a developer, I'd like to optimize YARN deployer, so I can deploy stream and the modules part of the definition rapidly.
R2991. I don't recall why [this commit | https://github.com/garyrussell/spring-xd/commit/ba15a1390f7e448dbc723ee76a45c2e239e0994e] was not applied to master but having the timestamp for each step in the history will be useful.    See [this github issue | https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd-modules/issues/24#issuecomment-154436643].  
R2992. With the inclusion of https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/commit/80b1d28be1c8b9a23099b145fe2dcf472bfa9697, any module that explicitly injected/looked up the SI EC don't need to do so anymore.    This issue is about simplifying those
R2993. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to 2.2.1 GA release, so I can leverage the latest improvements without breaking backwards compatibility. SHDP 2.3.0 uses Boot 1.3 and HDP and CDH versions that drop older Hive support. To avoid breaking changes we should instead use SHDP 2.2.1 that has backported any improvements that we need as well as move Spring and Hadoop versions to more recent ones.
R2994. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade to SI 4.2.2.GA release, so I can leverage the latest improvements.
R2995. If the output module is connected to a named channel, cannot be set up the property minPartitionCount, it is giving an exception.

R2996. As a user, I created a composed job with over 10 child jobs in the workflow; I expected to see 'a' job in the execution list page without any pagination, but instead I noticed empty pagination to skip to next page.
R2997. As a developer, I'd like to remove the hardcoded buildpack reference since the latest 1.6.2 ER release includes all the features required by Data Flow. 
R2998. In our system we have built quite a few custom modules. It is currently possible for the end user to mess up the configuration of these custom modules when creating multiple streams. They can create conflicting configuration in multiple streams. The conflicting config is nothing to do with spring-xd itself, it is related to our data flow and business process.    It would be nice to have some sort of StreamDeployValidator that I could implement and write my custom validation code. If this decides that the stream definition is not valid (according to my rules) then it could stop the deployment of a stream. The validator would need to be aware of the other streams somehow.    
R2999. When a problem occurs connecting to admin, we just get {{Unable to contact Data Flow Admin}} even if the connection is successful and some problem occurs when interpreting the result.    The exception is eaten.    Log an error including the exception.    Currently investigating an NPE in DataFlowTemplate @ line 77.
R3000. As a developer, I want to be able to set a partitioning key for the Kafka bus even when there is a single downstream module, so that I can take advantage of the native Kafka partitioning and message ordering support.
R3001. Add SSL and attachments to Mail sink module. see XD-2076 & XD-2498.  
R3002. See the attatched log (xd.out) showing :  {{  Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: A connection to a distributed system already exists in this VM.  It has the following configuration:    ack-severe-alert-threshold="0"    ack-wait-threshold="15"    archive-disk-space-limit="0"    archive-file-size-limit="0"    async-distribution-timeout="0"    async-max-queue-size="8"    async-queue-timeout="60000"    bind-address=""    cache-xml-file="cache.xml"    cluster-ssl-ciphers="any"    cluster-ssl-enabled="true"    cluster-ssl-keystore="/Users/dturanski/trusted.keystore"    cluster-ssl-keystore-password="password"    cluster-ssl-keystore-type="jks"    cluster-ssl-protocols="any"    cluster-ssl-require-authentication="true"    cluster-ssl-truststore="/Users/dturanski/trusted.keystore"    cluster-ssl-truststore-password="password"  ...  }}    Steps to reproduce:    Refer to: http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/latest/managing/security/ssl_example.html    1) Install the the attached keystore  2) Install attached gemfire.properties in $XD_INSTALL/xd/config  3) Install a copy of gemfire.properties in the server path,  e.g., if using the gemfire server app installed with the distribution,  $XD_INSTALL/gemfire,  and run bin/gemfire  4) Start the gemfire server  5) Start xd singlenode  6) Start the shell and deploy a stream using a gemfire module (this was reported with gemfire-json-server sink, but in theory it will affect any since it occurs during client cache creation).     Note: I verified this SSL configuration works with a simple SDG client against the XD server. (Use SDG 1.6.2, and gemfire 8.0.0).  Also, the gemfire-json-server example in the XD reference works as expected without the SSL configuration.     This may to be related to the module using a its own class loader. `java.lang.IllegalStateException: A connection to a distributed system already exists in this VM` happens because there are 2 instances of DistributedSystem created (one for each class loader?). This happens even when all the module jars are moved to xd/lib to force all gemfire classes to be loaded in the parent class loader.     
R3003. As a developer, I'd like to upgrade Boot and Spring Cloud Build revisions, so I can leverage the latest updates.
R3004. As a user, I'm trying to use {{counter}} sink with {SpEL}} expression, but I'm not able to use them in combination.

R3006. As a developer, I'd want to document the limitations of HSQL DB when using composed jobs. 
R3007. For some reason, the Integration {{MBeanExporterHelper}} is not preventing the standard context {{MBeanExporter}} from exporting the {{AbstractMessageRouter}}. This should be suppressed (when an IMBE is present) because it's annotated {{@IntegrationManagedResource}}.    Causes {{InstanceAlreadyExistsException}}.    Workaround in the stack overflow answer.    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33838502/error-deploying-more-than-one-stream-with-a-router-1-3-0    Could be an SI issue, but investigation needed. However, we should probably include the stream/job name in all MBeans for the stream (as is done for the integration exporter).

The only difference between node, is that the node in error has less memory.    When this occurs, node doesn't appear anymore on the admin ui. And deployed streams do not appear as incomplete, but they should if a node has disappear and deployment property _module.*.count_ is set to the number of nodes.    Thanks.    Mickaël

R3015. I would like to be able to use the SpringXDTemplate to find all executions for a specific job    Currently I use xdTemplate.jobOperations().listJobExecutions() then loop through all executions filtering the ones for the job I'm interested in.    It would be nice if JobOperations had something like this    {code:java}  /**   * List all Job Executions.   * @param jobInstanceId The instance of the job to get all executions for.   */  public PagedResources<JobExecutionInfoResource> listJobExecutions(long jobInstanceId);  {code}

I have following environment variables     XD_CONFIG_NAME = mycompany  And   SPRING_PROFILE_ACTIVE= prod, admin    i have XD configuration file (mycompany-prod.yml) with following security configuration    # Config to enable security on administration endpoints (consider adding ssl)  spring:    profiles: prod  security:    basic:      enabled: true # false to disable security settings (default)      realm: SpringXD  xd:    security:      authentication:        file:          enabled: true           users:            xdadmin: pwd, ROLE_ADMIN,ROLE_VIEW,ROLE_CREATE    I get a login screen, login works alright. When i logout - i still see all the tabs and contents in all the tabs. See the attached screenshot.  
R3020. I have IE 11. The XD admin UI stops responding after the login prompt and I have to kill the browser every time. It's not functional. I have not tried it with security turned off. Attach is the screenshot of the version.
R3021. I understand Kafka natively does not have the concept of message headers. However, Spring Integration messages do and a lot of SI components are built specifically for dealing with message headers (header-enricher, header-filter, header-value-router, etc...). In addition, message headers are very useful for tracking meta-information about messages as they progress through a system.    With the implementation of https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-3621; Spring XD has limited support for custom headers when using Kafka as a transport. I say limited, because it is required to list all custom headers explicitly in servers.yml in order for the headers to be retained by the MessageBus.    This is less than ideal because it means that it is necessary to know all potential custom header values a user will require before starting the environment.    It would be nice to extend this functionality so that it is not necessary to list custom headers in the configuration. Instead, when operating in mode=embeddedHeaders, Spring XD will simply embeds ALL headers in the Kafka message. Or alternatively, allow for a wildcard in the 'headers' configuration option so that it is not necessary to exhaustively list all possible custom header values prior to starting the system.
R3022. Spring XD Ambari plugin only supports HDB as job db. HDB is not good in production environment. It will be great if we can specify RDB in spring xd installation/config process.   
R3023. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/issues/1871
R3024.  The processor module which is failing to load castor classes from the module path.The code works fine with eclipse DIRT based test cases. I am attaching the code to this email. The jar that it built has the jars that it need at runtime in /module../lib folder.     The code worked fine when i put all the custom jars and application jar in xd/lib. Spoke to Thomas Risberg and confirm this is broken and need to be fixing.[^attachment-name.zip]

R3027. Requirements: Make the class loader of the custom XD module available to the code of the custom module.    Javassist's toClass method uses the thread's local class loader to [load classes|https://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/html/javassist/CtClass.html#toClass--]. This is most definitely inappropriate in the case of Spring XD modules, since many classes come from the lib/ directory of the module. Those will produce a ClassDefNotFound exception in javassist.    Currently the ModuleFactory basically "throws away" the class loader, after generating it:    {code}  	private Module createSimpleModule(ModuleDescriptor moduleDescriptor, ModuleOptions moduleOptions,  			ModuleDeploymentProperties deploymentProperties) {  		if (log.isInfoEnabled()) {  			log.info("creating simple module " + moduleDescriptor);  		}  		SimpleModuleDefinition definition = (SimpleModuleDefinition) moduleDescriptor.getModuleDefinition();  		ClassLoader moduleClassLoader = ModuleUtils.createModuleRuntimeClassLoader(definition, moduleOptions, this.parentClassLoader);    		Class<? extends SimpleModule> moduleClass = determineModuleClass((SimpleModuleDefinition) moduleDescriptor.getModuleDefinition(),  				moduleOptions);  		Assert.notNull(moduleClass,  				String.format("Required module artifacts are either missing or invalid. Unable to determine module type for module definition: '%s:%s'.",  						moduleDescriptor.getType(), moduleDescriptor.getModuleName()));  		return SimpleModuleCreator  				.createModule(moduleDescriptor, deploymentProperties, moduleClassLoader, moduleOptions, moduleClass);  	}  {code}    I think it would be sufficient if either the current module or the class loader itself could be injected into the custom classes of the custom XD module. As far as I can see I cannot get a grip on the Module instance in the current state of XD system.

R3030. As a developer, I'm adding new overrides to {{server.yml}} file; however, the overridden properties do not reflect even after the restart of server. 
R3031. Add spring.redis.pool.*  properties to server.yml, commented out to show default values., e.g.,        maxIdle: 8,     minIdle: 0,      maxActive: 8,     maxWait: -1  
R3032. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34817906/spring-xd-rabbitmq-partitioned-stream-deployment-in-failure
R3033. Add option to write to Splunk named index as an alternative to tcp.
R3034. PubSub consumers can support concurrency since the threads are competing consumers on the queue.    
R3035. In the following PR we removed the *RestLogoutSuccessHandler*.     https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/pull/1562    This is necessary, though, for REST calls and the Admin UI. Otherwise some weird UI behavior might occur due to the HTTP redirect.
R3036. Spring XD keeps passwords in text files such sas servers.yml, properties files, and module configuration files. Some users have requested a way to store encrypted values rather than clear text.  XD should provide a "hook" for users to provide a custom component to detect encrypted property values and decrypt them during container, admin, and module initialization.
R3037. All modules that allow groovy implementations (filter, script, transform, router, tcpclient) allow automatic refresh of the script when it changes. In the XD documentation it is stated that this refresh occurs every minute eg for filter at http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.3.0.RELEASE/reference/html/#filter "The script is checked for updates every 60 seconds, so it may be replaced in a running system. "     This set up can be seen in the spring xml for the modules - eg (again for filter)    {code:xml}  <filter input-channel="to.script" output-channel="output">  	<int-groovy:script location="${script:filter.groovy}" script-variable-generator="variableGenerator" refresh-check-delay="60"/>  </filter>  {code}    However from the spring integration documentation http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/4.2.4.RELEASE/reference/html/messaging-endpoints-chapter.html#scripting-config  it specifies that the refresh-check-delay parameter is actually in milliseconds - ie the above XD configuration would recheck the script every 60 milliseconds which may be a performance concern as it will be checking the lastmodified time of the script file.     Ideally this parameter would be configurable - in our case we would usually eliminate the refresh check altogether (set to -1) as our scripts will not change (or if they did a redeploy of the module would pick it up)    
R3038. The maxWait property from server.yml in the message bus section for kafka is not propagated through the code, it is ignored.

R3040. The following XD components have been identified to support SSL via an `sslProperties` property which points to the location of a properties file. The properties encryption extension for 1.3.1 does not currently apply to these:      * Rabbit Message Bus    * Rabbit Source    * Rabbit Sink    * Http Source (NettyHttpInboundChannelAdapter).     This can be made to work in the case of Rabbit since the latest RabbitConnectionFactoryBean supports individual SSL properties settings as an alternative to the properties file. The http source may be extended to use the same approach.

R3046. Custom conversion is broken.    If the custom {{MimeType}} does not match any of those in {{MessageConverterUtils.getJavaTypeForContentType}} then the channel configuration fails with    {code}  			throw new ModuleConfigurationException("Content type is not supported for " +  					channel.getComponentName() + "Type=" + contentType);  {code}    The code needs to consult custom converters to see what {{MimeType}} (s) they support - and the output Java type.      See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35639975/adding-a-custom-type-converter-to-spring-xd
R3047. if we put a custom module static properties in `/config/modules/job/module-name/module-name.properties` then we cannot completely remove the module -  you can delete module but you cannot upload new jar with the same name as it gives an error  - there is module already with the same name.    May be important to note that we had a zookeeper data corruption on which support asked us to upgrade. We couldn't upgrade just yet, so I cleaned up zookeeper and recreated all streams/job from original scripts.     I have observed this behavior after the corruption - I cannot tell for sure if the behavior was there or not before the corruption. In case it is not easily reproducible then it could be environment specific issue.    I may update JIRA once i get time to try it on my local distributed mode.  
R3048. In a case where reactor's ringbuffer is full and thus handling backpressure by blocking `onNext`, shutdown phase where `onComplete` is send will cause a deadlock.    This is shown by a thread dump during a shutdown. This will basically break further deployments for this stream in distributed mode while single node will show more errors during undeployment.    {code}  "pool-7-thread-1" #58 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x979fe800 nid=0x54de runnable [0x986ad000]     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (parking)    sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)    java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanos(LockSupport.java:338)    reactor.jarjar.com.lmax.disruptor.SingleProducerSequencer.next(SingleProducerSequencer.java:122)    reactor.jarjar.com.lmax.disruptor.SingleProducerSequencer.next(SingleProducerSequencer.java:97)    reactor.jarjar.com.lmax.disruptor.RingBuffer.next(RingBuffer.java:246)    reactor.core.processor.util.RingBufferSubscriberUtils.onNext(RingBufferSubscriberUtils.java:30)    reactor.core.processor.RingBufferProcessor.onNext(RingBufferProcessor.java:575)  {code}    {code}  "main-EventThread" #19 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x9b93a400 nid=0x54b1 runnable [0x9aefe000]     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (parking)    sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)    java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanos(LockSupport.java:338)    reactor.jarjar.com.lmax.disruptor.SingleProducerSequencer.next(SingleProducerSequencer.java:122)    reactor.jarjar.com.lmax.disruptor.SingleProducerSequencer.next(SingleProducerSequencer.java:97)    reactor.jarjar.com.lmax.disruptor.RingBuffer.next(RingBuffer.java:246)    reactor.core.processor.util.RingBufferSubscriberUtils.onComplete(RingBufferSubscriberUtils.java:54)    reactor.core.processor.RingBufferProcessor.onComplete(RingBufferProcessor.java:585)    org.springframework.xd.greenplum.gpfdist.GPFDistMessageHandler.doStop(GPFDistMessageHandler.java:170)  {code}    I've been crafting workaround for this by trying to wait reactor stream/buffer to get drained by gpdb and finally as last resort, forcing processor in reactor to shutdown.
R3049. When i use the admin-ui web portal which runs on port 9393, there is a load timeout issue by require.js, failing to load the login screen. Could the team please look into this issue ASAP, or give me some other alternative !sping-ui-issue.png|thumbnail!
R3050. The MapReduce samples should have "yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.address" since it might be needed in a multi node production cluster.
R3051. {{module compose foo --definition "time --fixedDelay=5 | shell --command=my.sh"}}    {code}  xd:>stream create bar --definition "foo | log" --deploy  Command failed org.springframework.xd.rest.client.impl.SpringXDException: Error with option(s) for module foo of type source:      command: may not be empty      command: may not be null  {code}    The problem stems from the fact that the options metadata validation is performed on the shell module before the property from the composed module is injected.    Disabling the validation annotations on the metadata avoids the problem.    {code}  //	@NotEmpty  //	@NotNull  public String getCommand() {  	return command;  }  {code}

R3053. I download the spring XD example projects, and run through the steps acccording the README file for the project. I tried to change the hadoop-site.xml, server.yml and wordcount.xml files, but I failed get the . I am blocked by this issue. Thank you very much in advance for help. Best Regards.
R3054. Hi,    If I use the module.[name].producer.paritionKeyExpression, and the module as also autoBindDLG enabled, the creates RabbbitMQ queues do not have the DeadLetter policy.  The first queue has it (xdbus.<stream>.0-0) but others do not have it (xdbus.<stream>.0-N).    Thanks    Mickaël    
R3055. i  unzip flo-spring-xd-admin-ui-client-1.3.1.RELEASE.jar to replace the existing spring-xd-admin-ui-client-1.3.1.RELEASE.jar,and clear my browser cache  then restart the  xd-singlenode，but i can't access Flo for Spring XD at the following URI endpoints :http://HOST_NAME:PORT/admin-ui/#/streams/create , i can't find the "flo" page!  
R3056.
