R1.The application must integrate with a blockchain network, capable of handling smart contracts and transactions. 
R2.The system requires the deployment and interaction with smart contracts, written in Solidity. 
R3.Implement mechanisms for the validation and verification of data. This involves checking the accuracy and integrity of data used for training models.
R4.An incentive system to reward contributors who provide accurate and valuable data is essential. This system should fairly distribute rewards, encouraging ongoing participation and quality contributions.
R5.Support continuous training and updating of machine learning models with new data submissions. 
R6.Efficiently manage Ethereum transactions, including the management of transaction fees and gas costs. 
R7.When integrated with 3rd party frameworks or used from a UI, we expect a user-friendly interface for interaction, including data submission and model prediction requests. This interface should cater to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
R8.When integrated with 3rd party frameworks or used from a UI, ensure the system is compatible with Python for backend processes and JavaScript for frontend interactions. 
R9.When integrated with 3rd party frameworks or used from a UI, ensure compatibility with TensorFlow models for loading and inference. 
R10.Must support both images and text for model training and prediction. 
R11.Implement an adaptive learning rate for the provided model.
R12.The system must be capable of hyper-tuning model parameters. 
R13.Track performance metrics systematically for model validation and troubleshooting. 
R14.Design the system architecture to be scalable to handle increasing data submissions and user interactions. 
R15.Ensure the system complies with data privacy regulations when handling user-submitted data. 
R16.Optimize computational and storage resources, particularly when interacting with the blockchain. 
R17.Implement an automated testing framework to ensure the system's consistent performance. This framework should cover various aspects of the system, including smart contract functionality and machine learning model performance.
R18.When integrated with 3rd party frameworks or used from a UI, must allow users to provide feedback on model predictions and system usability. 
R19.Implement robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches. 
R20.Develop comprehensive error handling for blockchain transaction failures and data submission errors.
