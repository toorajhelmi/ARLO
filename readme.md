# ARLO Project

## Overview
ARLO is a C# project focused on converting software requirements into architectural decisions. Utilizing GPT-4 for parsing and an ILP-based optimizer for decision-making, it streamlines the architectural design process.

## Key Components
- **RequirementParser**: Parses natural language requirements into ASRs.
- **Architect**: Develops architectural policies from ASRs.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Access the code on GitHub.
2. **Register your OpenAI Key**: See below.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Follow the setup instructions for necessary libraries and tools.
4. **Execute `CategorizedReqsExperiment`**: Configure and run the experiment with your system preferences.
5. **Review Output**: Analyze the generated architectural decisions.
